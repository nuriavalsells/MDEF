How do you plan to involve yourself personally in the narrative of your project?
</div>
<div style="background-color: #C5B9B4; padding: 10px; border: 0px solid #E6DB55;">
Have you set any boundaries within the topics you want to explore? Is there something you don't want to research about?
</div>
<div style="background-color: #C5B9B4; padding: 10px; border: 0px solid #E6DB55;">
How do you think the fact that you are doing this research in a completely different cultural context affects the project itself?
</div>

> **Video/Document:**

During this week we had a lot of difficulties to film a video, so I decided to create a document with Dhrishya's answers and design it in a way that it would represent the talking emphasis she put during the conversation. I recommend reading the document while listening to Dhrishya's audio.

> **Reflection:**

I chose Dhrishya's project for this exercise because I am very interested in her topic, and I thought we were connected in some way.

The fact that I am interested in her topic has made the activity very manageable, I enjoyed being able to talk to her and think of questions to ask her. I decided to ask her 4 questions, for the moment, because I still lacked some information, after all we are all at a very early stage of our projects.

I am satisfied with my questions, I think they are a very good starting point to continue asking other questions. I would have liked to do the video with Dhrishya, but it was very useful to have to transcribe and read many times the answers to understand what she wanted to transmit.

## **Contents**

**Autoethnography**: a qualitative research method, describr and analyze personal experiences to understand socio-technocal systems. Fundamental principles: responsibility, accountability, transparency, empathy and positionality.
	
- _Ethnography: social sciences research method: analyse how a group behaves in a context_

- _It's so personal, that is important to be consistent with your analysis and documentation_

The main qualities are the following:

**_Defined study boundaries:_** being able to describe the limits if the study

- Can I understand the object of my study?
- Can I define tge boundaries of my study?

**_Authenticity:_** Being personally involved, thoroughness for validity

- Was my FPP authentic?
- Was it meaningful?

**_Plausibility or Scholarship:_** How is it relevant to ongoing research?

- Is this useful? 
- Can it be written and explained?

**_Criticality:_** Imagining ways of thinking and acting differently

- So what?
- Did my actions make me learn about other things?

**_Self-revelaing communication:_** be honest with your findings. Communicate in an open transparent way

- Did I show my work transparently?
- Was there something I didn't show? Why?
    
**_Ability to Generalize:_** how does your FPP research relate to others? How do I scale-up from the "self"?

- Does it relate to others, can it be meaningful for others? 
- What kind of profile is the one which I am looking at?

**Alternative Presents:** understanding our overaching narratives. Making sense of the alternative presents you are creating with the support of...

**Ways of drifting:** there's two ways of using them, either helping us to climb ahead and define the process we want to follow, or either look back into the things we've done and see where this lead us to.

Different ways:

- **_Accumulative:_** Focusing on a specific aspects, Allows for deep understanding of a topic
- **_Comparative:_** Different perspectives on the same topic,
- **_Serial:_** DI are informed by previous ones, DI follow a particular order
- **_Probing:_** Exploit opportunities as they emerge, Personal motivations in specific enironments, Clear area of interest pre-defined
- **_Expansive:_** DI to explore new areas of interest, Not an specific order

**2. Map, visualize and analyze the evolution of your design space based on ways of drifting and reflect on the trajectories you might want to project. Create a narrative in relation to your alternative present**

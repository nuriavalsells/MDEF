## Reflection

The seminar "Designing with Extended Intelligences" has been one of the most useful seminars for me throughout the master's program.

Honestly, the topic of artificial intelligence has not particularly interested me, at least not until now. I have always thought of it as a very useful tool that still needs to be developed and reach all parts of society. However, I am aware that it brings with it security issues and moral considerations that we have not yet fully explored.

I greatly enjoyed seeing how, gradually, and thanks to the classes of Chris and Pietro, I began to take more interest in the subject as I learned about it. This week, for me, has been a clear example of the joy of learning. How, unexpectedly, providing the right information can activate new interests and horizons.

Clearly, my view of artificial intelligence has not changed 180 degrees in 3 days. I still don't understand many technical points, and I probably haven't yet considered important questions about bias, morality, the future, politics, security, privacy, etc. Nevertheless, I feel that I am starting to embark on the journey of doing so, or at least wanting to explore a little more.

I wanted to thank Pietro and Chris for your work and the help you have given us with our projects. I hope to see you soon :)

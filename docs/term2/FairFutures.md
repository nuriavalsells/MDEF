**Fair Future(s) | Designing with Collective Intelligence**

A four-day international event, this hybrid gathering involves talks, workshops, and self-organized working sessions.

In collaboration with the School of Digital Arts at Manchester Metropolitan University, the seminar explores emerging themes in the creative industries and decentralized governance. It introduces concepts like Digital Commons and Governance in Distributed Autonomous Organizations.

Participants from MDEF and SODA form international teams to discuss and create future scenarios addressing the perma/poly crisis. During working sessions, teams develop innovative governance and economic models to collectively produce a digital/physical artifact showcasing alternative modes of operation and creative expression. Projects are presented on DAFNE+, an EU research platform supporting digital content creators through blockchain technology.

**Keywords:Future(s), alternative governance, crafting multimedia artefacts**

Challenge:
The EcoToken Community Initiative (ETCI) addresses the urgent challenge of climate change, specifically targeting energy inefficiency in residential heating and cooling. This is a crucial issue as domestic energy consumption significantly contributes to carbon emissions and environmental degradation. The challenge lies not only in reducing energy consumption but also in fostering community engagement and responsibility towards sustainable practices. Another key challenge is integrating innovative technology in a manner that is accessible, transparent, and incentivizes positive behavioral changes related to energy use.

Solution: ETCI proposes a multi-phased solution combining blockchain technology, smart devices, and community-driven governance. The initiative starts with the distribution of EcoTokens, a digital currency that rewards eco-friendly practices. Integrating blockchain-enabled smart thermostats allows for efficient temperature regulation and energy consumption tracking. The use of blockchain ensures data transparency and security, essential for trust and accountability. Moreover, the formation of local DAOs empowers communities to collectively decide on larger sustainable interventions, such as building upgrades. This approach not only incentivizes individual actions but also promotes collaborative decision-making and resource allocation for broader environmental impact.

**Fair Future(s) | Designing with Collective Intelligence**

A four-day international event, this hybrid gathering involves talks, workshops, and self-organized working sessions.

In collaboration with the School of Digital Arts at Manchester Metropolitan University, the seminar explores emerging themes in the creative industries and decentralized governance. It introduces concepts like Digital Commons and Governance in Distributed Autonomous Organizations.

Participants from MDEF and SODA form international teams to discuss and create future scenarios addressing the perma/poly crisis. During working sessions, teams develop innovative governance and economic models to collectively produce a digital/physical artifact showcasing alternative modes of operation and creative expression. Projects are presented on DAFNE+, an EU research platform supporting digital content creators through blockchain technology.

**Keywords:Future(s), alternative governance, crafting multimedia artefacts**

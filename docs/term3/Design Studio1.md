## Now what?

- It went well but it's too open. The participants don't have enough context to know what we need from them, and so the input we get might not be super usefull.
- LAIA is like magic to them. But it's very evident the problem it has.
- With the idea the girls gave us, we need to figure out the "technical" part of LAIA.
- They would be open to participate again.

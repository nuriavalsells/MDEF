## Session 1 - 16th April

REFLECTION:

- many relationships with technology

- never had though of the description of technology and its difference with technologies, i still think in a veru practical way, but i like reflecting about it

- the less i had though about is the background relationship, the example of the heating going on in the background to my person, the interaction exists but its indirect because it's changing the context of my life. Other examples are: 

- There are some devices we have more than one kind of relationship with no? like the washing machine, i still need to change the filter every x time. a more efficient way of the technology i would be to "better" the background relationship, so not having to break it. - thats what the trend is about = moving technology more and more to background, is it good? not necessarily

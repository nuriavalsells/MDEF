## REFLECTION:

In the fisrt Design Ethics class, I found myself contemplating the various relationships we have with technology. It struck me that I had never really considered the distinction between technology and technologies before. I've always approached things in a practical manner, but now I realize the value in reflecting on these concepts.

One aspect that particularly intrigued me was the idea of background relationships with technology. The example of heating silently working in the background of our lives resonated with me. It made me see how technology can subtly shape our environment and interactions without us even noticing. This indirect influence on our lives is fascinating to consider.

Another point that stood out to me was the idea of having multiple relationships with certain devices. Take the washing machine, for instance. Not only do we rely on it to clean our clothes, but we also have to maintain it by changing the filter periodically. This duality made me ponder the notion of improving these background relationships to make technology more seamless in our lives.

Overall, the class discussion left me questioning whether the trend towards moving technology into the background is necessarily a positive development. While it can certainly make our lives more convenient, I wonder if we might lose something important in the process, like awareness of what impact does technology have on the world, knowledge on how it works...

## SELF EVALUATION

I consider my participation on class a 6.5/10. I'm aware that I couldn't attend the second class of the semester and I couldn't actively participate in the exercises. Even though, I enjoyed the lecture and took some insights that will be very useful in the future.

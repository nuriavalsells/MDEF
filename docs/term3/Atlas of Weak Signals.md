### Reflection
I really liked the first exercise of situating the context of that particular day. I think it is super necessary and I had never taken it into account. If it were up to me, I would have been talking about it for a long time, even so I liked that they unlocked this idea of writing down the context in which you are working in order to, in the future, take it into account.

A part of the dynamic that I found very interesting was that, after dedicating a whole hour to the research (which, to my surprise, was enough to give us a general idea) they proposed us to do an exercise of self-criticism and self-analysis. I think that contradictions are very present in our master and, perhaps, we do not address it as much as we should. I enjoyed talking about it with my colleagues and being able to reflect on the contradictions of each of us regarding the topic of "land".

Finally, I really enjoyed the whole process of the seminar in general, especially the more creative parts and the discussions with my colleagues. You could say that it was a bit of a speculative day, but for me it was also very necessary to go back to the kind of exercises we did in the first trimester.

Honestly, the last activity of the spider web was a bit complicated to understand and I think everyone interpreted it in their own way, but that's also the point!

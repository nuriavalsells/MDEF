# documenting design

> Pablo Zuloaga Betancourt

> Throughout the term

_Because of my late arrival in the master, I wasn't able to attend the first class of Documenting Design. Despite that, when I arrived, I was quickly put up to date about the contents of the class and the assignment it carried._

_Since I haven't lived this class as the rest of my colleagues, I figured I would reflect on how the process of building a website has been._ 

![Inspiration for my website](../images/WebsiteGoal.gif)

Emotions that have provoked me to create a website for the first time:

- Uncertainty

- Fear

- Curiosity

- Pride

- Desire to learn more

- Lack of knowledge

- Frustration

- Satisfaction

- Confidence 

- Dependence on others

**Situated IA introduction**

**_AI as automation_**

When we start talking about AI we don't want to imagine huge machines or technology, the proper word is automation.

Machine learning: it is used to automate tasks
- meaning assignment of a picture
- Production of photorealistic images

It means to automate through examples, not by coding and program
- Instead of inventing a code, give it examples of your desired result

<div style="background-color: #FFFFE0; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #E6DB55;">
AUTOMATE TASKS BY PROVIDING EXAMPLES
</div>

**_Short vocabulary:_**

- _Neural net:_ what has been coded, this structure/code that is capable to learn, autoconfigurate itself. There are several types of neural nets according to many things, on of them being the tool like images, sound, text...

- _Dataset:_ examples we give to the neural net in order to autoconfigurate.
    Datasets as the core of AI

- _Training:_ process in which the neural net selfconfigurates using the dataset.

- _Model:_ neural net that has already been trainned through the dataset.

    -  Model as a solidification/reification - for example chatgpt now has info until march 2023, it is the same model as the last year's one

- _Responsibility/Intervetion_ - the machine isn't responsible or accountable for what is doing, it's made by human decisions

- _AI it's a statistical tool_ - careful with the conception of creativity and AI, there is risk of mystifing the tool

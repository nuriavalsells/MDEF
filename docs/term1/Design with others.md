Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## **Deliverable**

_Group: Vania, Marcus, Carmen, Carlotta, Oliver, Everardo and Núria_

As a final delivery we came up with a community engagement plan to reach the goal we had set. The objective of the plan is to engage both Nest City Lab and BAM into a collaborative process with us to reimagine the street they share and come up with designs to potentiate and promote the stree's biodiversity of pollinating species.

While tracing the plan, we soon realized that the issue wasn'y which design we ahd to come up with to solve the biodiversity of the street, but how could we generate interest on the topic in the community so they would be motivated to participate. Our plan doesn't include a final producte design, it includes little actins/interventions that are meant to collaborate with the communities.

The first plart of the plan consists of a communication campaign, so we tried to design some of the posters that would be part of the campaign.

Finally, we made a video to illustrate how bees feel in the street. While emboding the bee figure in our intervention area, we became even more aware of the problem and confirmed our initials assumptions.

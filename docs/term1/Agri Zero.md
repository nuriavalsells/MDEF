The week we took the Agriculture Zero class with Jonathan we participated in two activities:

### _Valldaura visit_
Wednesday 15th November 2023, we met at 10am in the Mundet metro station to begin a little hike through the Collserola Park into Valldaura. Jonathan only gave us 2 instructions:

- Download the INaturalist app and collect as many species in it as possible.

- Scream "ecotone!" every time we see a change in a specie, a edge, a transition.

Through the hike we stopped a few times to comment what we were seeing and Jonathan explained many interesting things about the nature that surrounded us and the sites we saw.

When we got to the Valldaura house, we explored it together. We began in the quarantine room (built by MAEBB students from previous years), then we entered the house and met the current MAEBB students. We explored the green house and the carpentry lab and got a bit of an idea of what was going on in Valldaura.

Before lunch, we were asked to help the students with the self-growing food garden, that has been abandoned for so long. We were happy to help and get our hand a bit dirty.

### _Essential oils experiment_
On Thursday 16th we did one of two experiments using a traditional alambique to produce essential oil out of the laurel leafs some of our colleagues collected the day before at Valldaura.

1.Fill the vase (bell chamber) with water.

2.Close the tap (matter chamber) and seal it with flour dough.

3.Insert the laurel on the top, inside the matter chamber.

4.Incorporate the hat, or condensation chamber on top of the alambique.

5.Seal the joint between the matter and the condensation chamber with flour again.

6.Screw the cooling coil tube.

7.Fill the cooling chamber with ice.

8.Make the water in the bell chamber boil.

The result from a full bag of laurel leafs was a small portion of laurel essential oil
4.1 i 4.6

### _Soil analysis_
Also on Tursday 16th, we split into 4 groups and started anaylizing a type of soil Jonathan gave us. In my case it was soil from Delta de l'Ebre, south Catalunya.

We had 4 ways of analyzing the soil:

1.Texture: we followed the map to determine what kind of soil we were dealing with. In our case it was Loomy Sand.

2.Ph: we measured the Ph of our soil and other parameters with a simple test with color coding.

3.PO4: with the help of a simple test we analyzed a sample of our soil mixed with water to determine the level of PO4.

4.NO3: with the help of a simple test we analyzed a sample of our soil mixed with water to determine the level of NO3.

The final result of our soil is the following:

The week we took the Agriculture Zero class with Jonathan we participated in two activities:

### _Valldaura visit_
Wednesday 15th November 2023, we met at 10am in the Mundet metro station to begin a little hike through the Collserola Park into Valldaura. Jonathan only gave us 2 instructions:

- Download the INaturalist app and collect as many species in it as possible.

- Scream "ecotone!" every time we see a change in a specie, a edge, a transition.

Through the hike we stopped a few times to comment what we were seeing and Jonathan explained many interesting things about the nature that surrounded us and the sites we saw.

When we got to the Valldaura house, we explored it together. We began in the quarantine room (built by MAEBB students from previous years), then we entered the house and met the current MAEBB students. We explored the green house and the carpentry lab and got a bit of an idea of what was going on in Valldaura.

Before lunch, we were asked to help the students with the self-growing food garden, that has been abandoned for so long. We were happy to help and get our hand a bit dirty.

# The Machine Paradox

**What?**

The different goals of the Machine Paradox seminar were to talk about how technology affects society, explore new and unusual technologies that are out there but not widely known, make things quickly and effectively using various tools and methods, embrace a mindset of creativity and collaboration, and share what we know with others. 

The operation of the seminar basically consisted of unpacking and disassembling old and unused machines (TVs, printers, speakers, microwaves…) in order to understand how they work on the inside. Later on, once we have the components identified and prove that they work, figure out a new way to reassemble them, designing a new machine.

**How?**

_Forensics of the obsolescence_

The first part of the seminar (first 4 days) was about the forensics of obsolescence. This concept wants to talk about how technology isn’t a neutral element, it depends on many factors such as economic powers, influences, certain interests… At the end of the day, technology is a cultural artifact, it represents the society it grows into and within the whole process of developing technology, many cultural decisions have to be made.

The deliverable of the first part of the seminar was a Forensic Report on a chosen machine. I was lucky enough to work with Marius, Anna, Jorge, Flora and Anthuanet to deliver [the document of the Forensic Report](https://hackmd.io/1TI0p6wfRi2lh4JParedQA?view).

The thing that has shocked me the most these 3 days has been the disassembling part. Tearing apart the TV monitor and realizing that behind every screen we see, there’s actually real materials and not just an “ether” that “transports data” into the “cloud”. 
Learning the physical elements behind a screen, that for me is something unreal, untouchable, doesn’t belong to the world of objects, made me open my view to other products i use in my everyday life and think how might they be made, what’s inside of them…

It has reminded me of a video made by a friend of mine, very worth seeing:

It was very interesting, also, starting this project (that for me is a bit out of my league) with people I don't know, at all. It has been working out very well, I'm glad to see we all have a proactive attitude towards the class and I'm enjoying getting to know them through it.

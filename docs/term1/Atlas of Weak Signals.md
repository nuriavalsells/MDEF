# Atlas of Weak Signals

**Reflection on the process of building your initial Design Space**

Utilizing the AoWS method and adopting a multiscalar personal design space strategy, I crafted my initial design structure. This process facilitated my exploration of a variety of concepts that had never crossed my mind previously, at least not related to design. During this research, I discovered unexpected connections between various specific subjects, which have the potential to serve as activators to new original design approaches and concepts.

The exercise provided me with the opportunity to immerse myself in previously unknown territory, as a result, I was able to pinpoint the topics that resonated most deeply with me. The core themes that consistently surfaced in my mind the most were Rural Futures and Non-heteropatriarchal Innovation.


_Personal AoWS board and new suggestions_ 
My personal AoWS board contains the following elements and reflections on their connection:
Weak signals: Rural Futures and Non-heteropatriarchal Innovation
Areas of opportunity: Environmental Sensing and Design for social innovation.
Triggers: Locally Productive Globally Connected, Redesigning Habits.

My multiscalar personal design spaces features some of the elements of my workspace, the elements present in my AoWS and the references I am familiar with in the field Iâ€™m interested in.

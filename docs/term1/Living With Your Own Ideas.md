**What?**

**Deliverables**

**_Create a companion_**

The first deliverable of the seminar consists of a rapid lo-fi prototyping of a personal companion that wants to adress a topic of your live.
In my case, i decided to create a "Do You Want a Hug Machine" to represent my relationship with the concept of love. Although my heart is internally a mess and doesn't know what it wants, a simple gesture as a hug will satisfy it momentarily.

**_First Person Perspective Design Intervention_**

How does it feel to be out of context in Barcelona? Is Barcelona welcoming to non-local people? I decided to buy 24h Bus Turistic pass in Barcelona and spend a day moving around only with this transport. It has 2 lines of bus, I have a stop next to my house but Iaac is not very well communicated. By blending into the touristic bus i want to observe my own city with other eyes and see how i react when i place myself into an unknown context in my own city.

âž” Thoughts During the Experience:

1. It felt a bit challenging to adapt to the new mode of transportation since I'm so accustomed to the public one.
2. I was shy to speak catalan in such an "international" environment, the workers who attended me were also surprised.
3. I couldn't help but feel that people around us were indifferent and largely ignored our presence.
4. The perspective from above, almost like watching a movie, provided a unique viewpoint.
5. Even though it was a route I frequented daily, the slower pace allowed me to discover new restaurants and shops I had previously overlooked.
6. I found the experience somewhat boring.
7. The environment struck me as overly commercial.
8. The midday traffic made the journey feel particularly tiresome, especially around 3:00 PM.

## **Contents**

The contents we were given in the fourth design studio session revolved around "reflection as a design tool". They way I understood it the most was with the following tool:

After we complete an intervention or a design or a project, it is crucial to go through the process of reflection. To reflect means to learn, to look back and to ask questions to yourself in order to go forward. 

In our course we have many ways of reflecting and they are structred in 3 levels:

- deliverables → reflective diary

- feedback/reviews → reflective critique

- design studio → reflective dialogue

<br></br>

With that in mind, we had to go back to the collective design space and add/move/take out the papers and threads according to our reflection after the first intervention.

Once this was done we had to form new groups to create the second collective intervention.

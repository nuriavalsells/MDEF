## **Contents**

The week we took the Biology Zero class with Nuria we were fortunate to make an experiment thet consisted in cultivating microbes.

1.Build our own medium to host the microbes

2.Sterilize the container with the medium in a pressure cooker and vert the medium into a, also sterile, petri dish.

3.Go "hunting" for microbes with the petri dishes

4.After 1 day in the incubator at 25ÂºC, some colonies are formed and we can observe them through the microscope

### Design Idea
The idea of this GMO modified domestic plant is to genetically modify plants to change color in response to water stress. This is achieved by introducing genes responsible for color changes, such as anthocyanin pigments, under the control of water stress-responsive promoters. When the plant is deprived of water, the promoter activates the color-changing gene, causing a visible color change. This method can serve as an indicator of plant water status and aid in the early detection of water stress.

The structure was made of biodegradable bricks composed of corn stalks and living mycelium (a type of fungus). The living mycelium bricks were used to construct a tower that responded to environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, by changing its properties over time.  |

BioUrban is a vertical garden system that uses microalgae to capture carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. It can be applied to urban structures like buildings and highways to help purify the air in cities.|

Vietnamese designer Nguyen La Chanh created a bath mat made of moss that thrives on the humidity of a bathroom. The moss mat is a functional and decorative piece that incorporates living organisms into the design. |

They've also designed biological walls, known as "H.O.R.T.U.S. XL Astaxanthin.g." These living installations combine microalgae and real-time data monitoring to create an ever-changing and self-regulating environment. |

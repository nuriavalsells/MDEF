## **Contents**

The week we took the Biology Zero class with Nuria we were fortunate to make an experiment thet consisted in cultivating microbes.

1.Build our own medium to host the microbes

2.Sterilize the container with the medium in a pressure cooker and vert the medium into a, also sterile, petri dish.

3.Go "hunting" for microbes with the petri dishes

4.After 1 day in the incubator at 25ºC, some colonies are formed and we can observe them through the microscope

## **Deliverable**

### Design Idea
**Issue: Transmission of insect-borne diseases**

The global problem of mosquito-borne diseases is a major health concern affecting many people around the world. Mosquitoes, especially certain species, can transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus and chikungunya. These diseases are more severe in poor areas and can lead to many illnesses and, unfortunately, even death. Mosquitoes are everywhere, and factors such as urban expansion and climate change are making the problem worse.

**Possible solutions:**

- Reduce the spread of disease

- Disease resistant plants

- Predatory insects that kill disease carriers

**Organisms with similar functions in nature:**

- Naturally Resistant Plants: Plants that naturally exhibit resistance to insect-borne diseases.

- Predatory insects in ecosystems: understanding the mechanisms of population control of natural enemies of disease-carrying insects.

**Property Recipient:**

- Wild mosquito populations: Wild mosquito populations are genetically modified to reduce their ability to transmit disease.

- Crop varieties: Implement disease resistance measures on key crop varieties to protect agricultural yields.

- Predatory insects in urban environments: Enhancing natural enemies of disease-carrying insects to control their populations in urban areas.

Other ecological balance considerations: We need to ensure that the introduction of modified organisms does not disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem.

The structure was made of biodegradable bricks composed of corn stalks and living mycelium (a type of fungus). The living mycelium bricks were used to construct a tower that responded to environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, by changing its properties over time.  |

## **Reflection**

With the Bio Zero seminar, I initially found myself somewhat not 100% interested with the topic of biology and science in general. The prospect of incorporating biology into my future projects seemed incidental, and I figured I could manage by reaching out to experts if needed. However, despite my low interest in the subject matter, I realized the significance of staying updated on scientific developments. This realization was sparked by Nuria's class, where the coverage of current scientific news caught my attention and became an aspect I found extremely intriguing.

Moreover, I developed a newfound appreciation for the concept of using nature as a toolbox, especially in the realm of design. The idea of drawing inspiration and solutions from the natural world resonated with me. Even though the specific topic of the seminar may not have deeply captivated me, the broader perspective of staying informed about scientific advancements and embracing nature as a source of innovation left a lasting impression. It made me consider the broader implications and applications of these ideas beyond the immediate context of the seminar, potentially influencing my approach to future projects.

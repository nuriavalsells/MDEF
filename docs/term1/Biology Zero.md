The week we took the Biology Zero class with Nuria we were fortunate to make 2 experiments.

### _Cultivate microbes_
1.Build our own medium to host the microbes

2.Sterilize the container with the medium in a pressure cooker and vert the medium into a, also sterile, petri dish.

3.Go "hunting" for microbes with the petri dishes

4.After 1 day in the incubator at 25ÂºC, some colonies are formed and we can observe them through the microscope

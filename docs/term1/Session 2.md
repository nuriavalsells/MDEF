We were introduced with the concept of Design Intervention.

_What can a design intervention be?_

Can and should be developed with others in context
- An opportunity to co-create and iterate prototypes with others

- An experience that transforms yourself and others - open your mind to new scopes

- An action to start building trust - the first step to human relationships is trust in order to be able to co-create

- Am activity to bring difficult topics to the table - safe space

- An experience to learn and from others

- An experience to learn through a situated action - understanding the context that will allow us to propose something.

- To understand the direction that one's trying to take in the project.


_Relationship between Design Intervention and Design Space_

The Design Intervention will allow us to show the context that the Design Space is mapping so that we can create iterations of the Design Space diagram and investigate new elements in it. A Design Intervention doesn't have to be perfect or unique, is a key part of a process that consists in several actions that will lead us to build the final design space (if it ever exists). A Design Intervention can be used to understand issues we don't control, to clear our minds about them, to research unknown paths or to validate already existing ones.

The four key roles a Design Intervention can have within a Design Space are:

➔ Organizational: to visualize the ideas we have in a Design Space

➔ Narrative: to give a voice to these ideas, so we can understand their process and development

➔ Performative or Participative: to involve stakeholders or make it understand to the public

➔ Inspirational: to research new developments and continue the journey


**_Exercise_**

**A. Start sharing the elements we have printed in a big board and relate them to the ones everyone brought.**

**B. In groups, create a Collective Design Space**

According to the Collective Design Space Mural we assembeled a group with similar interests. My group was formed by Annna, Everardo, Francisca and Drishya. Together we talked about our areas of interest and came up with a group Collective Design Space.

**C. Think about a Design Intervention to make within the shared interests and Design Space.**

Finally, after exploring many options we decided to conduct the following Design Intervention:

_We've designed a collective Design Intervention to explore how alterations of your face can change your perception of yourself; either hide a part of you or enhance it. We want to give the possibility of changing your face to a specific group of people, and allow them to reflect on reconfiguration of the body. This change they can apply to their faces, might be on purpose to hide a part they don't like or either enhance another one they love._

_For the intervention, we have organized an event or party at Everardo's house with our friends. We believe that the relaxed atmosphere of this type of space gives the participant more room to get carried away._

_Our intervention wants to explore the following questions:_

_- Did you choose to alter your face to hide or change a part of yourself you don't like? Or to enhace your existing identity?_

_- After changing your face, do you feel more like yourself or less like yourself?_

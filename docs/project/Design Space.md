# **Design space evolution**

_The Design Space is the representation of my thinking process into my master's project._

### 1. First Design Space 
The first iteration was made after the AoWS seminar and card game.

### 2. From digital to analog
Decision to switch to analog to be able to move better and add/remove elements.

### 3. Back to digital, the real first DS
After some documentation, total change of the Design Space into a diagram with different areas of interests.

For the rest of this year and beggining of 2025, we plan on expanding Laia within El Clot community to gain more recognition form the locals and become a reference for everyone, and also so we can design a final version of Laia. We aim to build a final prototype that can be used in the public spce without supervision.

Looking ahead on the long term, we envision the Laia project evolving into a scalable platform that can be implemented in diverse urban contexts around the world. We would like to create a “Laia Guide” to collect and group all the steps we have done with the project in El Clot. From the initial research of communities, the communication with them, the data collection from the City Council, the development of the prototype (hardware and software) and other relevant information to reproduce the framework in another context. 

By making the Laia framework an open source and reproducable project, we are committed to creating more resilient, sustainable, and equitable cities for future generations.

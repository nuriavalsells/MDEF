### 23th october, with Jana

This was my first ever Design Studio Review and my first meeting Jana also. For that day I had done the work of creating my Atlas of Weak Signals, my Multiscalar Personal Design Space and my (not so) Final Design Space. We started off talking about the firsts two, at first it was my turn to explain what I had done, what are my interests and opportunities... It was difficult for me to justify every single element in the Final Design Space, I realized I had done it guiding my self with impulses instead of rationally thinking. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, but I regret doing it like this because I felt like the Design Space was a bit shallow.

The talk with Jana helped me realize I had to go deeper into my interests and my directions, even if these were too many for the project. I'm looking forward to starting a mini research on this to finally map my Design Space and then start deciding what I can and want to focus on.

After the session I set for myself, as personal homework, to modify the Design Space adding elements and relating them better between them.

### 06th november, with Roger

My second Design Studio review was with Roger last Monday. The session was very helpful to validate how I felt about my own Design Space.I feel that I am still a bit lost with the Design Space topics, but lost in a good way. I have too big a space that encompasses too many topics, each one of them in itself is already too big.

With Roger we discussed that I will have to start focusing the seminars and activities of the weeks in order to figure out which side I want to focus on. Use the exercises and projects to learn about my own Design Space. Following this, we went through a list I made of action or Individual Interventions that I could do myself in my day to day life to explore the different themes of the Design Space and start eliminating things in it.

My next goal is to reduce the design space based on what really interests me.

Important note: Roger is encouraging me to take advantage of my "privilege" of being from Barcelona to complete the Design Space with references and resources that I already know and can reach.

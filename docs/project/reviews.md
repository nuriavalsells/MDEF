## **23/10/2023 with Jana**

This was my first ever Design Studio Review and my first meeting Jana also. For that day I had done the work of creating my Atlas of Weak Signals, my Multiscalar Personal Design Space and my (not so) Final Design Space. We started off talking about the firsts two, at first it was my turn to explain what I had done, what are my interests and opportunities... It was difficult for me to justify every single element in the Final Design Space, I realized I had done it guiding my self with impulses instead of rationally thinking. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, but I regret doing it like this because I felt like the Design Space was a bit shallow.

The talk with Jana helped me realize I had to go deeper into my interests and my directions, even if these were too many for the project. I'm looking forward to starting a mini research on this to finally map my Design Space and then start deciding what I can and want to focus on.

After the session I set for myself, as personal homework, to modify the Design Space adding elements and relating them better between them.

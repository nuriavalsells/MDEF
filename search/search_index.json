I\u2019m a 24-year-old from Barcelona who graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Industrial Design and Product Development Engineering from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya. After graduation, I began working at Azimut 360, a non-profit cooperative dedicated to the engineering and installation of photovoltaic systems, both nationally and internationally. However, I soon realized that my interests extended far beyond designing everyday objects and products in a more elegant, aesthetic way. I wanted to use my skills to make a positive impact on society. That\u2019s why I pursued a Master\u2019s degree in Social Design. Through my studies, I have expanded my knowledge and vision of industrial design as a tool for transforming everything that is already established. From industrial and manufacturing processes to the most everyday objects that perpetuate attitudes in society that need to change in order to move forward. I spent 1 year taking a Master in Social Design at NABA (Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti) in Milan, Italy. It was a very interesting year, I learned a lot from my teachers and collegues and I got to participate in meaningful projects that motivated me a lot. When I started, this last September, the second course of the Master, I realized that the second year wasn\u2019t gonna fufill my expectations and the experience wasn\u2019t motivating enough for me. The 15 th of October I made the decision to move back to Barcelona and start the Master in Design for Emergent Futures. So far, I\u2019m very happy with my decision and I think it will bring me a lot of positive things, while living again in my beloved Barcelona <3.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#get-to-know-me","text":"Hello, my name is N\u00faria Valsells Vilalta, and I\u2019m excited to introduce you to my MDEF documenation page.

As neighborhoods become increasingly globalized, there is a concerning trend of diminishing community connections despite the potential for greater cultural interchange. In the hustle and bustle of city life, the focus often shifts towards productivity and profit, overshadowing the people who call these neighborhoods home and leading to an individualized way of living. Neighborhoods are gradually losing their local identity as global influences take hold. The proliferation of online platforms and digital services has played a significant role in facilitating global connections, reducing reliance on local resources and knowledge. People increasingly turn to these platforms for services, information, and social interactions, leading to a diminished role for traditional neighborhood institutions and networks. Moreover, the replacement of local shops with big chains reflects global consumer trends, eroding the unique character of local shopping districts and limiting opportunities for small, independent businesses. Additionally, the rise of globalized media and entertainment has contributed to a homogenization of cultural tastes among residents. Traditional local festivals and cultural practices risk being overshadowed by global events and trends, resulting in a loss of cultural diversity and identity within Barcelona\u2019s neighborhoods. Furthermore, the proliferation of digital communication platforms and social media has altered the dynamics of human connections within these neighborhoods. Residents increasingly rely on online networks and virtual communities for socializing and sharing information, reducing the frequency and quality of face-to-face interactions and potentially contributing to feelings of social isolation and detachment from the local community. In response to these challenges, the Laia Project aims to counteract the negative effects of globalization and technology by building a set of artifacts and frameworks to help local communities reconnect and participate in neighborhood initiatives. Despite acknowledging the existence of globalization and technology, the project adopts a mindful approach, utilizing technology and other resources in a way that aligns with the needs of the community. By applying artificial intelligence in a local context, the project transforms technology into a collective intelligence that empowers communities to reclaim their voice and strengthen their connections. Though the Laia Project has its roots in the El Clot neighborhood of Barcelona, its vision extends beyond the confines of a single locality. The intention is to develop a framework that can be applied to similar contexts suffering from similar challenges, both within Spain and beyond. By addressing the root causes of neighborhood disconnection and isolation, the Laia Project aims to create more resilient, sustainable, and equitable communities for the future.","title":"context"},{"location":"project/context/#_1","text":"The Laia Project arises in response to the ongoing gentrification of Barcelona, and other major cities, and the subsequent challenge of preserving local knowledge.

It functioned almost like a confessional, offering a speculative way for people to express their thoughts. You can find all the documentation for the first prototype in the MicroChallenge I page.

Mosquitoes, especially certain species, can transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus and chikungunya. These diseases are more severe in poor areas and can lead to many illnesses and, unfortunately, even death. Mosquitoes are everywhere, and factors such as urban expansion and climate change are making the problem worse. Possible solutions: Reduce the spread of disease Disease resistant plants Predatory insects that kill disease carriers Organisms with similar functions in nature: Naturally Resistant Plants: Plants that naturally exhibit resistance to insect-borne diseases. Predatory insects in ecosystems: understanding the mechanisms of population control of natural enemies of disease-carrying insects. Property Recipient: Wild mosquito populations: Wild mosquito populations are genetically modified to reduce their ability to transmit disease. Crop varieties: Implement disease resistance measures on key crop varieties to protect agricultural yields. Predatory insects in urban environments: Enhancing natural enemies of disease-carrying insects to control their populations in urban areas. Other ecological balance considerations: We need to ensure that the introduction of modified organisms does not disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem.

At first with a presentation from Markel about Holon and the context we were gonna work with the next days. But mostly, Markel introduced to us the concept of \u201cSoil\u201d and what it entails, for example: the microorganisms living in and out of soil, the issue of waste and soil contamination, a cultural sense of the soil as in the history and traditions it holds, the different technologies and methods to manage soil or the worldwide food transport system. All of these topics are related to one another going through the concept of \u201csoil\u201d. As a second part of that first class we had an assignment to fulfill. We had to explore 100 m2 of soil that Markel had not delimited and do a research on the conflicts/problems that we detected. As a representation of this research, we had to create an installation to tell what we had discovered. In my case, when I started to explore the area I saw many conflicts that could interest me but I decided to focus on the soil as a literal concept. I spent 20 minutes walking around the area, just observing how the soil changed, with my eyes fixed on it. I detected that there were many textures and colors in that soil, and the interesting thing is that I detected that there were groups of textures and colors, and those groups were also associated to different sounds. To represent my research, I made a very simple video with the textures, colors and sounds that I detected with my mobile phone. Land \u00b6 La Borda visit The second day started with a visit to La Borda building. Adri\u00e0 gave us a very detailed tour of all the spaces in the building, he even generously invited us to visit his house. The interesting part of the visit was the explanation of the project behind the La Borda building. La Borda is the first cooperative housing in Spain and is built on a land in cession of use. I think it is appropriate to recommend the 30 minutes documentary about the project. https://www.ccma.cat/3cat/t1xc3-lacol/video/6247592/ With the visit we realized the importance of politics in the design and the possibilities that we have within reach and we do not always see. That second day was dedicated to the concept of \u201cLand\u201d, and with the beginning in La Borda it was clear to us from the beginning that land is not only a natural element, it also has social, political and cultural connotations. After we had replenished ourselves with so much information we proceeded to have meetings with the groups that we had created the day before and started to think about areas of real interest that we all had and to do research on organizations that are currently working in these areas or communities that might be interested in collaborating. In my case, the group I was part of, we were very interested in the biodiversity of the city, the coexistence between species and the use of architecture/design to re-integrate the animal world into the urban world. Visits \u00b6 Makers Zone BCN visit The initiative aims to be \u201caccessible to anyone\u201d and to stimulate community engagement, becoming a reference point for diverse creative activities. The association behind the project consists of individuals with varied interests, ranging from cosplay and decoration to carpentry, forging, and laser work. The goal is to establish a versatile maker space where anyone can participate and promote traditional craftsmanship. To use the tools, individuals need to become members and pay a monthly fee, and the space also offers stable workstations, resembling a coworking environment but with noise, smells, and people constantly engaging in creative activities. The founders emphasize the importance of a multifunctional space that encourages continuous knowledge exchange while maintaining well-defined areas for specific material usage. Ateneu fabricacio Gracia visit The Ateneu de Fabricaci\u00f3 de Gr\u00e0cia, situated in a renovated former industrial warehouse in the Vila de Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood, is a public space dedicated to education and project creation in digital manufacturing, particularly emphasizing digital fabrication. As the fifth facility in the Ateneus Network of Barcelona, its mission is to promote creativity and innovation through socio-technological development projects using design and art methodologies, with a specific focus on digital literacy, craftsmanship, textiles, fashion, and biomaterials. The space is equipped with software and manufacturing machines that empower the community to transform ideas into tangible products for present and future societal needs. The Ateneu de Gr\u00e0cia features four specialized workspaces, including areas for textiles and fashion, additive manufacturing and electronics, a laboratory for biomaterials and biotechnology, and the Taller Brut for heavier or larger-scale fabrication. Additionally, an open and versatile space called \u00c0gora accommodates exhibitions, workshops, conferences, and houses a ceramic 3D printer. Deliverable \u00b6 We spent the last two days of the seminar in our class at IaaC and in groups trying to reach the final goal of the seminar: assembling all the different concepts and learnings about soil and land, our personal interest and the surrounding communities to design a future community intervention, taking also care of the community engagement and the whole process it takes to finally design product/service\u2026 Group: Vania, Marcus, Carmen, Carlotta, Oliver, Everardo and N\u00faria Goal: Potentiate the integration of biodiversity in Carrer d\u2019\u00c0laba, Poblenou, Barcelona. Communities: Nest City Lab (indoor garden/coffe shop/cultural space) & BAM (Associai\u00f3 Bioarquitectura Meditarr\u00e0nea) As a final delivery we came up with a community engagement plan to reach the goal we had set. The objective of the plan is to engage both Nest City Lab and BAM into a collaborative process with us to reimagine the street they share and come up with designs to potentiate and promote the stree\u2019s biodiversity of pollinating species. While tracing the plan, we soon realized that the issue wasn\u2019y which design we ahd to come up with to solve the biodiversity of the street, but how could we generate interest on the topic in the community so they would be motivated to participate. Our plan doesn\u2019t include a final producte design, it includes little actins/interventions that are meant to collaborate with the communities. The first plart of the plan consists of a communication campaign, so we tried to design some of the posters that would be part of the campaign. Finally, we made a video to illustrate how bees feel in the street. While emboding the bee figure in our intervention area, we became even more aware of the problem and confirmed our initials assumptions. You will find our whole thinking process in this Miro Board: Final Reflection \u00b6 Thinking about the project where we worked on making Carrer d\u2019\u00c0laba in Barcelona more biodiverse, I had some good and not-so-good feelings about it. What Went Well: Teamwork: It was nice working with different people. Everyone had their own ideas, and it was interesting to see how we could put them all together. Focus on Community: Instead of just coming up with a final design, we decided to get the community involved. We wanted people to care about making their street more full of life, especially for pollinators like bees. Small Actions Instead of Big Designs: We chose to do small things with the community instead of just making one big thing. This way, we could keep working with the community and not just finish a project and leave. What Could Have Been Better: Not Enough Time: The biggest problem was that we didn\u2019t have enough time. Making a whole plan for the community in just a week was tough. More time would have helped us think deeper. Missing Theoretical Learning: I wish we had learned more theory about the problems we were trying to solve. Understanding more about biodiversity and community engagement would have made our plan stronger. Need for Examples: It would have been great to see examples of other projects like ours. Seeing what worked in other places could have given us good ideas. Final Thoughts: I liked the project, but having more time and learning more theory would have made it better. Also, looking at other projects could have given us cool ideas. I learned that making a community care about something is more important than just making something for them. In the future, I hope we have more time for projects and learn more about the theories behind what we\u2019re doing.","title":"7.design with others"},{"location":"term1/Design%20with%20others/#design-with-others","text":"Adri\u00e0 Garcia i Mateu, Markel Cormenzana & Milena Calvo Juarez 21-24 November 2023","title":"Design with others"},{"location":"term1/Design%20with%20others/#contents","text":"","title":"Contents"},{"location":"term1/Design%20with%20others/#soil","text":"The first day we met at C\u00f2opolis, in Can Batll\u00f3 to start the more theoretical part of the day.

This method is a new way for designers and creators to experiment their own design research on themselves (their body, their environment, theirs interests, theirs tools\u2026) The method says that we can use our own bodies to explore, to communicate, to research. This allows us to take the design process to another level, to analyze our whole body. When involving the body into the design process you relate the product you design with the experience your body lives. FPP allows us to be situated as actors in environments and generate change. Acknowledging situated and partial knowledge, creating interactive, transversal and open-ended RtD. Involving yourself into the design process also brings all kinds of knowledge. It\u2019s the responsibility of the designer to entangle it into the process (culture, history, values, identity, ways of working\u2026). At the same time, you also bring all of your skills. Involving yourself is also a political act because you decide what to do and what not to do. The mix makes the design unique for yourself. FPP allows different temporalities to coexist in the same process. You create past, present and futures with your experience, imagination and memory. You bring your roots, your whole brain. At the end of the day, the goal of the First Person Perspective is to support affirmative creativity; avoid thinking what is right or wrong, instead analyze how the project/prototype impacts myself while testing it in my everyday life. Deliverables \u00b6 Create a companion \u00b6 The first deliverable of the seminar consists of a rapid lo-fi prototyping of a personal companion that wants to adress a topic of your live. In my case, i decided to create a \u201cDo You Want a Hug Machine\u201d to represent my relationship with the concept of love. Although my heart is internally a mess and doesn\u2019t know what it wants, a simple gesture as a hug will satisfy it momentarily. First Person Perspective Design Intervention \u00b6 How does it feel to be out of context in Barcelona? Is Barcelona welcoming to non-local people? I decided to buy 24h Bus Turistic pass in Barcelona and spend a day moving around only with this transport. It has 2 lines of bus, I have a stop next to my house but Iaac is not very well communicated. By blending into the touristic bus i want to observe my own city with other eyes and see how i react when i place myself into an unknown context in my own city. Bus Turistic from Nuria Valsells i Vilalta on Vimeo . The experience started from Iaac, Thursday November 2 nd , when I embarked on the journey to get to the tourist bus to get back home. It took me 2 hours to get home, I had to stop to change lines and I forced myself to listen to the audio guide the whole way. At first, it felt a bit challenging to adapt to the new mode of transportation since I\u2019m so accustomed to the public one but once i got the the station i just had to buy my tickets, that\u2019s when I felt shy to speak catalan in such an \u201cinternational\u201d environment, it also felt like the workers who attended me were also surprised. As the touristic bus journey continued through the streets of Barcelona, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the people around us were often indifferent, ignoring our presence. This provoked a weird feeling in me, even more when it was mixed with the perspective from above, almost like watching a movie, providing a strange viewpoint for urban sightseeing. Even though the route I was taking was no different than the one I take everyday, the slower pace of the touristic bus allowed me to discover new restaurants and shops that I had previously overlooked. While I did appreciate this aspect, I found the overall experience a bit boring. Reflection \u00b6 Things that could have been done better or differently: Do an action that better reflects the tourist experience in Barcelona: the Tourist Bus maybe isn\u2019t the most effective way to see Barcelona from a tourist perspective, I\u2019ll keep in mind to explore other ways to pursue this goal. Do it more times: it would be interesting to see how the experience changes when it\u2019s repeated more than once. Interact more with people: during the action i was completely a sponge, i didn\u2019t intend to interact with anyone or anything actively, i wonder how this would change the experience. Reflections: Separate myself from the action: I initially wanted to change my view of Barcelona and see the city from completely different eyes. While I was on the bus I found myself trying to force another gaze of the city and failing at it, this caused a bit of frustration. What I realized after that, is that I cannot separate who I am in my own actions, so I have to be conscious about it and accept this mixture between the event and my person. I will always be biased, as the more conscious I am about, the more coherent I will be with my actions and results. Test before imposing: after the action took place, I realized that if I\u2019d had to design a similar action for someone else, maybe I would\u2019ve made it more complex and effective (collect data in a more precise way, join more than one action in a period of time, involve 3 rd parties\u2026) but at the same time, probably, less adequate for the \u201cuser\u201d or the person doing it. It made me go slower and easier on the process, be more patient on what is worth discarding and what is worth my attention. I tend to be fast, impatient, effective, resolutive\u2026 This method is making me slow down and appreciate what I would probably miss if I designed as I\u2019ve always designed. What now?: When I was doing a brainstorm to decide what action I would take, I came up with a pretty long list of possibilities that relate somehow to my design space. Even though for logistic reasons I had to choose one, I still have the list and I plan on doing some of the interventions I thought of.","title":"4.living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"Oscar Tomico, Kristina Andersen & Angella Mackay 31-2 November 2023","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#content","text":"The \u201cLiving With Your Own Ideas\u201d seminar is focused on the First Person Perspective Design Research.

Roles of Prototyping in 1PP Research through design Reflection \u00b6 It is interesting to think about the new role of designers as a change of positioning within the relationship it has with the community it wants to serve, to think about the First Person Perspective in design. Until now I had always learned that designers, architects, engineers\u2026 where this omnipotent figure that could solve a problem by producing products or services for the user. These concepts hold many assumptions that don\u2019t make any sense anymore; as designers we know what users need, everyone interacts with a new product or service the same way, the concept of a \u201cgood design\u201d as an fully useful product for everyone everywhere and many more worth mentioning. Doing the thought process of placing the role of the designer inside the community, as a stakeholder or element in a system that works, has initially left me with the feeling that the First Person Perspective limits us as designers by saying we can only impact the systems we are part of. While this is the first reaction I had, I\u2019ve realized that by forming part of the system we can have much more efficient well-oriented solutions to our designs. You no longer are imposing ideas; you are just one more piece of the puzzle, needed to be completed but useless on its own. I\u2019m looking forward to see how this theory can be applied and how can I break with my already learned conception of the role of the designer. As for the roles of prototyping. I have little experience with prototyping and doing hands-on design, I\u2019ve only done a couple of models during my bachelor many years ago. I hadn\u2019t though about what role does prototyping has in a design process, I assumed it was the last part of a project, once you have the final design and you want to present it. I see know the potential of prototyping and the fact that it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, only useful for the project. It is very interesting to have this possibility, the one I\u2019m most interested about is the prototyping as a as a vehicle for inquiry. I believe people are more communicative and expressive when having their hands full, you can extract a lot of unrelated information form an specific practical activity with a group of people.

Roger Guilemany and Jana Tothill What? Areas of Intervention in a Multiscalar Design Space Contents \u00b6 We were introduced with the concept of Design Intervention. What can a design intervention be? Can and should be developed with others in context - An opportunity to co-create and iterate prototypes with others An experience that transforms yourself and others - open your mind to new scopes An action to start building trust - the first step to human relationships is trust in order to be able to co-create Am activity to bring difficult topics to the table - safe space An experience to learn and from others An experience to learn through a situated action - understanding the context that will allow us to propose something. To understand the direction that one\u2019s trying to take in the project. Relationship between Design Intervention and Design Space The Design Intervention will allow us to show the context that the Design Space is mapping so that we can create iterations of the Design Space diagram and investigate new elements in it. A Design Intervention doesn\u2019t have to be perfect or unique, is a key part of a process that consists in several actions that will lead us to build the final design space (if it ever exists). A Design Intervention can be used to understand issues we don\u2019t control, to clear our minds about them, to research unknown paths or to validate already existing ones. The four key roles a Design Intervention can have within a Design Space are: \u2794 Organizational: to visualize the ideas we have in a Design Space \u2794 Narrative: to give a voice to these ideas, so we can understand their process and development \u2794 Performative or Participative: to involve stakeholders or make it understand to the public \u2794 Inspirational: to research new developments and continue the journey Exercise A. Start sharing the elements we have printed in a big board and relate them to the ones everyone brought. B. In groups, create a Collective Design Space According to the Collective Design Space Mural we assembeled a group with similar interests. My group was formed by Annna, Everardo, Francisca and Drishya. Together we talked about our areas of interest and came up with a group Collective Design Space. C. Think about a Design Intervention to make within the shared interests and Design Space. Finally, after exploring many options we decided to conduct the following Design Intervention: We\u2019ve designed a collective Design Intervention to explore how alterations of your face can change your perception of yourself; either hide a part of you or enhance it. We want to give the possibility of changing your face to a specific group of people, and allow them to reflect on reconfiguration of the body. This change they can apply to their faces, might be on purpose to hide a part they don\u2019t like or either enhance another one they love. For the intervention, we have organized an event or party at Everardo\u2019s house with our friends. We believe that the relaxed atmosphere of this type of space gives the participant more room to get carried away. Our intervention wants to explore the following questions: - Did you choose to alter your face to hide or change a part of yourself you don\u2019t like? Or to enhace your existing identity? - After changing your face, do you feel more like yourself or less like yourself? Reflection \u00b6 Reflection on the Collective Design Space \u00b6 Doing the Collective Design Space was a bit overwhelming for me at first. From having to place my cards to, then, looking at the whole wall once it was finished. The concept of not having a right/wrong reasons to place your concepts disturbed me a little bit, but I soon went along with it. Once I looked at the wall I also felt a bit overwhelmed, so I quickly focused on a specific area of it, the one that interested me the most. Even though I choose an area of the wall, I was interested in all the groups that were formed, every topic chosen could\u2019ve fit in my own interests. Despite that, I decided to go with a group that was doing something different from what I\u2019m used to, so that I could explore more other options. Reflection on the group work \u00b6 The group work was very intense from the beginning, we choose an area of the Collective Design Space that was very plural, it had a lot of topics, and we couldn\u2019t do all of them. That\u2019s why we spent quite a bit of time, at first, to figure out what everybody was interested in and what direction we could take. It was a difficult conversation for all of us because we all wanted to compromise for the group but still be interested on the topic. After a few meeting, we kind of figured it out, and then it was time to think about the intervention. The design of the intervention wasn\u2019t easy either, but we got the hang of it as soon as we decided the goal we wanted to reach: explore how alterations of one\u2019s face can change the perception of oneself. At the beginning, we thought about playing with face prosthetics or deformations, while also exploring the identity of a community as a concept. Our main idea was to build some face prosthetics and introduce ourselves to a small Ball Room community in Barcelona to do the intervention. We soon realized we didn\u2019t have the time and resources to deliver this kind of intervention, and we had to tone it down a few knots to make it fit into our context. The final result of our intervention left aside the research of a community\u2019s identity and focused more on the perception of altering your own face. It has been good reflecting on the whole process we\u2019ve been through to understand that, even though in the beginning of an experience you have some expectations, you also have to adapt to your colleagues, the work pace of everyone and the resources you have and try to achieve a similar goal while being coherent with everything. Personal Design Space update \u00b6 The way my Design Space has changed thanks to this experience isn\u2019t the most obvious one. After reflecting on the Design Intervention concept and gone through the exercise, I\u2019ve changed 2 things of my Design Space. Firstly, I\u2019ve added a sub-part that connects 2 weak signals: social media and non-heteropatriarcal innovation. In this sub-part I want to fit in my interest in the perception we have as a society of \u201cbeauty\u201d and how it affects us, specially women and specially teenagers and middle-aged women. I\u2019ve been interested to see how the new generations are evolving with the same concept of \u201cbeauty\u201d and this differences confronts the generations/age groups when living in society. A couple of decades ago, the concept of \u201cbeauty\u201d was a much closed box where, if you didn\u2019t fit into, you were out of. Nowadays, it seems to be a bit more open and accepting but still very much a box. It\u2019s also interesting to see how, even though we are more \u201copen\u201d to different forms of beauty, at the same time there are much more \u201cbeauty treatments\u201d, operations and interventions to alter our faces and bodies\u2026 Second of all, I\u2019ve gathered a list of Design Interventions I could personally do to explore other parts of my Design Space I don\u2019t know much about or O haven\u2019t specifically experienced in my own skin. This session and the \u201cLiving with your own ideas\u201d seminar have helped me see the importance of \u201cforcing\u201d myself to live certain experiences to further my knowledge and evolve into my interests.

Start sharing the elements we have printed in a big board and relate them to the ones everyone brought. B. In groups, create a Collective Design Space According to the Collective Design Space Mural we assembeled a group with similar interests. My group was formed by Annna, Everardo, Francisca and Drishya. Together we talked about our areas of interest and came up with a group Collective Design Space. C. Think about a Design Intervention to make within the shared interests and Design Space. Finally, after exploring many options we decided to conduct the following Design Intervention: We\u2019ve designed a collective Design Intervention to explore how alterations of your face can change your perception of yourself; either hide a part of you or enhance it. We want to give the possibility of changing your face to a specific group of people, and allow them to reflect on reconfiguration of the body. This change they can apply to their faces, might be on purpose to hide a part they don\u2019t like or either enhance another one they love. For the intervention, we have organized an event or party at Everardo\u2019s house with our friends. We believe that the relaxed atmosphere of this type of space gives the participant more room to get carried away. Our intervention wants to explore the following questions: - Did you choose to alter your face to hide or change a part of yourself you don\u2019t like? Or to enhace your existing identity? - After changing your face, do you feel more like yourself or less like yourself?","title":"Contents"},{"location":"term1/Session%202/#reflection","text":"","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term1/Session%202/#reflection-on-the-collective-design-space","text":"Doing the Collective Design Space was a bit overwhelming for me at first. From having to place my cards to, then, looking at the whole wall once it was finished. The concept of not having a right/wrong reasons to place your concepts disturbed me a little bit, but I soon went along with it. Once I looked at the wall I also felt a bit overwhelmed, so I quickly focused on a specific area of it, the one that interested me the most. Even though I choose an area of the wall, I was interested in all the groups that were formed, every topic chosen could\u2019ve fit in my own interests. Despite that, I decided to go with a group that was doing something different from what I\u2019m used to, so that I could explore more other options.","title":"Reflection on the Collective Design Space"},{"location":"term1/Session%202/#reflection-on-the-group-work","text":"The group work was very intense from the beginning, we choose an area of the Collective Design Space that was very plural, it had a lot of topics, and we couldn\u2019t do all of them. That\u2019s why we spent quite a bit of time, at first, to figure out what everybody was interested in and what direction we could take. It was a difficult conversation for all of us because we all wanted to compromise for the group but still be interested on the topic. After a few meeting, we kind of figured it out, and then it was time to think about the intervention. The design of the intervention wasn\u2019t easy either, but we got the hang of it as soon as we decided the goal we wanted to reach: explore how alterations of one\u2019s face can change the perception of oneself. At the beginning, we thought about playing with face prosthetics or deformations, while also exploring the identity of a community as a concept. Our main idea was to build some face prosthetics and introduce ourselves to a small Ball Room community in Barcelona to do the intervention. We soon realized we didn\u2019t have the time and resources to deliver this kind of intervention, and we had to tone it down a few knots to make it fit into our context. The final result of our intervention left aside the research of a community\u2019s identity and focused more on the perception of altering your own face. It has been good reflecting on the whole process we\u2019ve been through to understand that, even though in the beginning of an experience you have some expectations, you also have to adapt to your colleagues, the work pace of everyone and the resources you have and try to achieve a similar goal while being coherent with everything.","title":"Reflection on the group work"},{"location":"term1/Session%202/#personal-design-space-update","text":"The way my Design Space has changed thanks to this experience isn\u2019t the most obvious one. After reflecting on the Design Intervention concept and gone through the exercise, I\u2019ve changed 2 things of my Design Space. Firstly, I\u2019ve added a sub-part that connects 2 weak signals: social media and non-heteropatriarcal innovation. In this sub-part I want to fit in my interest in the perception we have as a society of \u201cbeauty\u201d and how it affects us, specially women and specially teenagers and middle-aged women. I\u2019ve been interested to see how the new generations are evolving with the same concept of \u201cbeauty\u201d and this differences confronts the generations/age groups when living in society. A couple of decades ago, the concept of \u201cbeauty\u201d was a much closed box where, if you didn\u2019t fit into, you were out of. Nowadays, it seems to be a bit more open and accepting but still very much a box. It\u2019s also interesting to see how, even though we are more \u201copen\u201d to different forms of beauty, at the same time there are much more \u201cbeauty treatments\u201d, operations and interventions to alter our faces and bodies\u2026 Second of all, I\u2019ve gathered a list of Design Interventions I could personally do to explore other parts of my Design Space I don\u2019t know much about or O haven\u2019t specifically experienced in my own skin. This session and the \u201cLiving with your own ideas\u201d seminar have helped me see the importance of \u201cforcing\u201d myself to live certain experiences to further my knowledge and evolve into my interests.","title":"Personal Design Space update"},{"location":"term1/Session%202/#deliverable","text":"To see how the intervention was developed, make sure to check out the video.","title":"Deliverable"},{"location":"term1/Session%203/","text":"Third session \u00b6 When? 6 th November 2023 Who? Laura Benitez What? Personal narratives, collective storytelling Contents \u00b6 The contents of Laura\u2019s class were focused on the philosophical concept of narrative and story-telling. The first hour was a more theoretical hour in which Laura explained very well several concepts of various authors around the theme of Design Studio that day. During that hour we talked about power, bodies, interactions and relationships, matter, worl(d)ing, and, finally, figures. With the concept of figure, Laura proposed the first deliverable. It was an individual exercise that you can find in the \u201cDeliverables\u201d section. After the break, Laura proposed a second exercise. In this case, it was a group exercise. We all stood around the class and Laura started by tying a fennel stitch of red thread in her hand. The exercise consisted in passing the thread among all of us while controlling the network that was being formed with a reflection on how we are living the master and the learning of the last weeks. The final result was a network of red thread that united us all, symbolizing the shared experience and the collective storytelling about our journey in the master. Reflection \u00b6 This was my first philosophy class with Laura. The truth is that it seemed to me a very different class from the ones we have done so far. The contents that Laura explained to us are very far from what I have studied and it is a little difficult for me to follow the line sometimes. I think that, for all of us, it is even more difficult because it is not in our usual language. Anyway I am very interested to see how design and philosophy can really intertwine. I was especially interested in Spinoza\u2019s concept of potestas/potentia, at first I didn\u2019t understand it but with the examples and the explanation I seem to get the concept. On the other hand, the concept that resonated with me the most was \u201cWe-are-in-this-together-but-we-are-not-one-and-the-same\u201d; to focus on difference from a relational ontology, taking into acconut all of the relationchips between the agents in the \u201csystem\u201d, although they are all different. I think we can apply this concept to every project we make and I would like to further keep it in mind. I finally loved that Laura quoted Donna Haraway.

Roger Guilemany and Jana Tothill What? A collective design action with humans and/or non-humans Contents \u00b6 The contents we were given in the fourth design studio session revolved around \u201creflection as a design tool\u201d. They way I understood it the most was with the following tool: After we complete an intervention or a design or a project, it is crucial to go through the process of reflection. To reflect means to learn, to look back and to ask questions to yourself in order to go forward. In our course we have many ways of reflecting and they are structred in 3 levels: deliverables \u2192 reflective diary feedback/reviews \u2192 reflective critique design studio \u2192 reflective dialogue With that in mind, we had to go back to the collective design space and add/move/take out the papers and threads according to our reflection after the first intervention. Once this was done we had to form new groups to create the second collective intervention. Deliverable/Intervention \u00b6 My group was made by Carmen, Sophie and myself. We started talking about our interests and ended up writting a Collective Design Space to have a clearer vision of our common interests. Our intervention involved all the members of our class and some of our friends outside the master. The aim of the exercise was to make people think about their digital identity, how are we perceived on the internet? 1- We asked our classmates for permission to show their Instagram profiles to our friends. 2- We created a survey with very specific and limited response questions in order to have the same model with everyone. 3- We showed the 18 profiles to our friends, each profile was analyzed only once. They had to answer the survey while analyzing the profile. 4- We collected all the data about the profiles and put them in anonymous card format, in order to set up the game. 5- We asked people in the class to try to identify themselves with one of the profiles we had hung on the wall. When they identified themselves they had to paste their picture on the card. 6- We revealed the final solution of the people to whom the profiles corresponded, and recorded their reactions. 7- We conducted interviews to find out if they identified with the description our friends had made of them. Reflection \u00b6 Biases in Answers: It\u2019s important to know that the people giving opinions might have their own personal preferences or views. We should tell them about this before the activity so that everyone understands that the results might be a bit one-sided. Missing Political Question: We forgot to ask about people\u2019s political views, and that could have been interesting. Even though it\u2019s a tricky topic, it can tell us a lot about how people see each other online. Limited Questions and Similar Answers: The questions we asked had only a few possible answers, making everyone\u2019s profiles seem kind of the same. It would be better to have more varied questions that let people share more about themselves. Class Reactions: The coolest part was seeing how everyone reacted when we showed them what others thought about them. This made everyone think about how they present themselves online and what others might think. In the future, we can make the questions more open-ended and talk about possible biases before starting. We could also try asking about political views, even if it\u2019s a bit tricky. This exercise was great for making us think about how we come across online and how others see us. What now? \u00b6 \u2794 what would you like to learn more about, related to this project or issue? The mental health implications there can be when we talk about digital identity. Many people aren\u2019t aware they are creating a digital identity when using social media, but it\u2019s intrinsic in the use of these platforms. Whether we want it or not, they way we are perceived by others can affect our mental health and I would like to learn more about the implications it can have to our well-being. \u2794 what follow-up is needed to address any challenges or difficulties? Maybe a previous conversation with the people involved on the topic, so we can also analyze the mental process happening when they discover how they are being perceived by others. \u2794 if you could do the project again, what would you do differently? After doing the exercise, I would change some questions of the survey and also the way we approached people\u2019s reactions to their digital profile. I think many people took it as a game and many reflections were lost by approaching it like a fun thing and now like an exercise of self-reflection. \u2794 how will your efforts on this project contribute to your career? I think I\u2019m shaping a path on my career that doesn\u2019t have a clear end, but that is visibly touching some social and contemporary issues like mental health and life in the digital era. \u2794 how can society better address the problem from the project? It\u2019s a complex issue to address because it\u2019s a big one, I think the first step is to reflect on it and make people aware of it. From here, we could redesign the way we use social media or how social media is designed in order to reduce the negative impact in can have in our mental health and self-esteem. \u2794 where do you go from here? What is the next step in the process? I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going from this.

Design Dialogues DESIGN DIALOGUES I \u00b6 Urbanism and mental well-being \u00b6 There are many contributing factors to mental health and mental illness, but urban planning and design can help determine whether (or not) the city is a positive, supportive, nurturing place to live, with features that support people\u2019s mental health. \u00b6 We live in an expanding world, in which it is predicted that by 2050, 69% of the world\u2019s population will live, work and play in close proximity to many millions of other people. But rates of stress, depression and mental illness are also increasing in urban areas globally. Changes in social networks, including the rise of social media, and social support systems in cities are leading to isolation and loneliness. The burden of mental health problems is increasing everywhere, with rising rates of conditions like anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, aggravated by increasing violence and trauma from natural and man-made disasters, political strife and division, and human rights violations. This is well-documented by the major global health agencies. Depression is the primary driver of disability worldwide; and one in four people will experience a mental health problem at some point in their lives, although there are currently big gaps in the data, especially in low- and middle-income countries. New paradigms to support mental health are therefore needed. One area of promise, is a new mental health urbanism, which has been named \u2018restorative urbanism\u2019; how urban design can foster human flourishing in a rapidly expanding world. The \u2018signatures\u2019 of restorative urbanism include well connected cities and effective wayfinding systems; high-quality aesthetics in urban form; dynamic, multi-functioning neighbourhoods that support people\u2019s everyday activities; and letting nature right into the city core.

The operation of the seminar basically consisted of unpacking and disassembling old and unused machines (TVs, printers, speakers, microwaves\u2026) in order to understand how they work on the inside. Later on, once we have the components identified and prove that they work, figure out a new way to reassemble them, designing a new machine. How? \u00b6 Forensics of the obsolescence \u00b6 The first part of the seminar (first 4 days) was about the forensics of obsolescence. This concept wants to talk about how technology isn\u2019t a neutral element; it depends on many factors such as economic powers, influences, certain interests\u2026 At the end of the day, technology is a cultural artifact; it represents the society it grows into, and within the whole process of developing technology, many cultural decisions have to be made. The deliverable of the first part of the seminar was a Forensic Report on a chosen machine. I was lucky enough to work with Marius, Anna, Jorge, Flora, and Anthuanet to deliver the document of the Forensic Report. To create the document, we went through a process of disassembling an old LCD screen from beginning to end. We started by disassembling the main parts to understand it, then assembling them again to see which components were working and which weren\u2019t. We found out the connection between the motherboard and the screen wasn\u2019t working, so the machine was powered and turned on but couldn\u2019t play any content. We then continued disassembling the LCD screen itself and did some research on the different layers of filters it has. We were interested in powering on the backlight of the screen, but the connection cables were too old, and we accidentally broke them. We ended up with 2 functional strips of 80 LED lights each; we could power on and off the strips by little 10 LED strings. Rethink and reconnect \u00b6 The second part of the seminar \u201cThe Machine Paradox\u201d started at the end of the first week, once we had analyzed every component in our broken machine and categorized which ones worked and how they worked, it became the time to brainstorm new machines from what we had around. We had to build new machines basing our design on 4 principles: Honesty: the same design has to explain itself, do not hide anything. Simplicity: reducing processes and materials to the essential number. Uselessness: without a real and useful functionality for anyone. Process: acknowledge the process behind the design and give it value. With my group, once we got all the information, we did a brainstorm together to put on a piece of paper all of the ideas all of us had been gathering the previous days. We saw that there were a lot of ideas coming from all 6 of us, maybe too many. So, we decided to group the ideas into 3 main topics and split into pairs to explore these topics and come up with a proposition. The 3 final ideas we got out of this brainstorm were: an endless cycle machine to activate a ventilator, a FOMO machine to reflect on the pain screens induce on us, and a random Tik Tok scroll machine to represent the frustration of the lack of control. After evaluating the ideas and consulting with the teachers, we chose the FOMO machine. The FOMO machine, or The Fuck Duck Machine, is a device that wants to reflect on \"how much pain are we willing to take to feed our FOMO?\". We understand the concept FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) as the anxiety created by an event happening elsewhere and you didn't attend. The Fuck Duck Machine feeds this FOMO feeling by revealing part of the content on the screen every time you press a button that also induces pain. Once we had the idea, we had to properly design it and plan the whole building process. We agreed on the design and saw that the machine had ultimately 3 parts: the main box, the motor and Arduino for it, and finally the pain button. Since we all knew what materials and methods we were going to use for the parts, we split them considering the personal interests and skills of everyone. In my case, I started building the pain button with Annna. The proper building of the machine was the longest part and the most intense one. A lot of us were facing machines and materials we had never touched before, and it was a bit challenging. Personally, I really liked being able to research and investigate how to make a button that induces pain to the user. At the end of the day, we couldn\u2019t find anything on the market similar because it goes against regulations, so we had to build it ourselves. The first plan was to 3D print a button to integrate the internal part of a lighter (which would induce a small electroshock every time you clicked it). The process of 3D printing was difficult and long, and we soon realized that we had to also integrate the button that would give the signal to the Arduino board, so we had double complexity. We changed plans and built a transparent block of layers of laser-cut acrylic, so we could control the size of the holes on every layer and integrate both buttons (that were completely different). Finally, the challenge was to create a \u201ccover\u201d that would activate both buttons at the same time and allow the electricity to pass to the finger pressing it. We considered plastic, but we were faced with the same problem as before; it was too complex and time-consuming (we were running out of time at this point). We finally built a 3-layer wooden cover to go on top of the buttons with a hole for the cable to electroshock. The last problem we had was that the electricity didn\u2019t go through the cable if the wooden cover was on, and, in fact, it only worked if a finger or a metallic piece pressed it. We solved the problem by putting copper tape around it. Once we all finished the building process, we had the final result of our Fuck Duck Machine. It was the moment to shoot a <1 minute video self-explanatory on how the machine worked and what it did. We received help to draw our storyboard, and once this was done, the filming process was pretty quick. We got to do some acting and have some fun after finishing the machine. Reflections \u00b6 19/10/2023 17:55 \u00b6 After completing the Forensics of the obsolescence part The thing that has shocked me the most these 3 days has been the disassembling part. Tearing apart the TV monitor and realizing that behind every screen we see, there\u2019s actually real materials and not just an \u201cether\u201d that \u201ctransports data\u201d into the \u201ccloud\u201d. Learning the physical elements behind a screen, that for me is something unreal, untouchable, doesn\u2019t belong to the world of objects, made me open my view to other products i use in my everyday life and think how might they be made, what\u2019s inside of them\u2026 It has reminded me of a video made by a friend of mine, very worth seeing: The impact of the internet from helena boet on Vimeo . It was very interesting, also, starting this project (that for me is a bit out of my league) with people I don\u2019t know, at all. It has been working out very well, I\u2019m glad to see we all have a proactive attitude towards the class and I\u2019m enjoying getting to know them through it. 28/10/2023 10:59 \u00b6 After presenting the final project the day before Yesterday, we presented our unuseful machine, The Fuck Duck Machine. Today, after a restful night and some time to reflect, I\u2019ve gathered a few insights from the past few weeks. Firstly, collaborating with a group of unfamiliar faces flows more smoothly when we\u2019re engaged in practical, hands-on activities. It was my first time working with my team (and meeting them at all), and we quickly understood how we all worked and what we were able to do at any given point. I think this fast learning from each other was caused by the intensity of the project but also because it was a practical project. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t have learned that much if we had spent the 2 weeks all sitting at a table talking and hypothetically designing. As for how my relationship with technology is evolving, I still empathize with what I wrote in the last reflection; the power of comprehending the inner workings of things. Last week, I was talking about how much it shocked me to see the components behind an LCD screen. This week I\u2019ve seen this importance also in understanding the machines and techniques we use to build. For example, when Santi very kindly explained to me how the laser cut machine worked and all of the steps you have to take before sending the file to cut, I understood and learned what he was explaining. Later on, when I had to manage the machine by myself, I didn\u2019t remember the steps by memory but because I understood them, and it made sense to me. This logic can apply to every machine and material I\u2019ve used, such as the 3D printer, Arduino, vinyl cutter, woodworking, electroshock, and more. Another important lesson I\u2019ve learned is that in the face of failure, it\u2019s wiser to attempt to repair what has gone wrong before scrapping the whole project. However, there\u2019s a fine line when it comes to investing your energy in a fix. It\u2019s crucial to know when it\u2019s best to move on. I\u2019m still learning when to let go or not of my initial ideas. I\u2019m a planner and I like following straight paths, but in prototyping and design in general, there isn\u2019t such a thing. Lastly, I\u2019m aware I wouldn\u2019t have accomplished this project or the learning I take with me without the help of our teachers and the collaboration of my colleagues. At the end of the day, no one knows everything, and everyone knows a bit of everything. If I had to do this by myself, I would\u2019ve designed a much less original machine in a much longer period of time.","title":"3.the machine paradox"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#the-machine-paradox","text":"Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga, Guillem Camprodon, Oscar Gonzalez, Josep Marti Elias, Petra Garajov\u00e1, Adai Surinach & Mikel Llobera 17-27 October 2023","title":"The machine paradox"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#what","text":"The different goals of the Machine Paradox seminar were to talk about how technology affects society, explore new and unusual technologies that are out there but not widely known, make things quickly and effectively using various tools and methods, embrace a mindset of creativity and collaboration, and share what we know with others.

During the presentation, Colmanares shared his personal and professional experiences, highlighting his experience as a Latin American migrant and his work in digital strategy and responsibility in artificial intelligence. Throughout the talk, concepts such as polycrisis, artificial intelligence and the influence of metaphors and words were addressed, highlighting the importance of adaptability, critical thinking and a deep understanding of interrelated global challenges. The seminar was not presented as goal-directed, but based on intentions. It focused on intuition, the learning process, present experiences, long-term development and states of being, rather than on achieving concrete results or focusing on future outcomes. Andr\u00e9s sought to help us broaden our perspective on design, especially in the context of polycrisis, and to align our learning with cultural, ecological and social transformations. The importance of trust, respect, collaboration, inclusion, and active listening was emphasized from the outset. \u201cCriticism is valued as long as it is constructive and avoids personal attacks.\u201d The course adopted a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach, prioritizing collaborative learning over the traditional teacher-student dynamic. Andr\u00e9s encouraged us to consider each other as peers or participants in a collective learning experience. The training put a lot of emphasis on giving relevance to the real-world context in which we live, including the current climate emergency and the various crises. We created a safe space to reimagine the world and acknowledge responsibility to those who were not present in the room. On Friday 12 th , we undertook the final activity of the seminar, which was divided in two parts. The first part was positioned in CosmoCaixa, the Science Museum of Barcelona. There we found a sized earth globe in the sun, that served us as the main focus for the action we were going to make.

The content presented by Andr\u00e9s was fascinating, although I confess that I find it difficult to visualize how to apply it concretely to my projects and real life. However, I consider that this difficulty can also be an opportunity to explore new ways of integrating the learnt knowledge into my daily practice. Andres proved to be an excellent teacher, standing out for his ability to convey complex concepts in an accessible way. His emphasis on values such as trust, respect and collaboration from the outset created an environment conducive to learning. Regarding the final activity, although it was interesting, I would have liked to have had the opportunity to visit the Cosmo Caixa as well. Other than that, I was very sad that I could not participate in the beach activity and had to leave my group alone. Although it would have been an activity out of my comfort zone, I think it is positive to live these experiences.

How do you plan to involve yourself personally in the narrative of your project? Have you set any boundaries within the topics you want to explore? Is there something you don't want to research about? How do you think the fact that you are doing this research in a completely different cultural context affects the project itself? Video/Document: During this week we had a lot of difficulties to film a video, so I decided to create a document with Dhrishya\u2019s answers and design it in a way that it would represent the talking emphasis she put during the conversation. I recommend reading the document while listening to Dhrishya\u2019s audio. Audios: Nuria Valsells i Vilalta \u00b7 Dhrishya Q&A tandem Reflection: I chose Dhrishya\u2019s project for this exercise because I am very interested in her topic, and I thought we were connected in some way. The fact that I am interested in her topic has made the activity very manageable, I enjoyed being able to talk to her and think of questions to ask her. I decided to ask her 4 questions, for the moment, because I still lacked some information, after all we are all at a very early stage of our projects. I am satisfied with my questions, I think they are a very good starting point to continue asking other questions. I would have liked to do the video with Dhrishya, but it was very useful to have to transcribe and read many times the answers to understand what she wanted to transmit. Session 2 - 30 th January \u00b6 Personal Project \u00b6 When I start to think about the narrative of my project, what voice it has, what personality I want to give it, what actions move it? These are the first results: Tandem Project \u00b6 What personality would I like this project to have? Reflection: I have to admit that thinking about my project in terms of \u201ccommunication\u201d right now is difficult. In fact, many of the things I have included in the Miro templates, I had not thought of before and were not preconceived. I decided to make the templates that I found most useful and most instinctive to respond to. I liked to be able to write, for example, the purpose of my project, the causes it fights for, the verbs and actions, the attitudes\u2026 I am very interested to see how these aspects progress, as for the moment they are very broad and with little detail. I wonder if, as the course progresses, I will change my mind a lot. For the time being, I am satisfied to see the more \u201ccommunicative\u201d part of the project written, it gives me something to hold on to in order to move forward. Session 3 - 13 th February \u00b6 Personal Project \u00b6 Select at least 4 initial audiences you want to reach from your stakeholders: Think about the communication barriers with them Which media do they use and how? What do you want to achieve by communicating wth them? What will the message be? Complete the canvas for audience engagement - communication matrix Reflection \u00b6 Doing the Communication Matrix, for me, has been a very useful exercise in the moment I am in the project. Right now, I am choosing in which communities I want to work. The exercise has not only helped me to think about how I would approach these communities, but also to make a list of these communities and see more clearly in which direction my project is going. The hardest part for me to answer was the \u201cMedia\u201d part. I think that my project will have a fairly analogous media, without much presence in social networks (although not nonexistent, thes will be important to disseminate). Thinking in the initial phases in which I am, I must perceive the communication with my stakeholders as something individual, personalized and face to face. Session 4 - 27 th February \u00b6 Personal Project \u00b6 Project Presentation: Microsite or slides defining your project, its personality, stakeholders, and communication strategy.

I recommend reading the document while listening to Dhrishya\u2019s audio.

The fact that I am interested in her topic has made the activity very manageable, I enjoyed being able to talk to her and think of questions to ask her. I decided to ask her 4 questions, for the moment, because I still lacked some information, after all we are all at a very early stage of our projects. I am satisfied with my questions, I think they are a very good starting point to continue asking other questions. I would have liked to do the video with Dhrishya, but it was very useful to have to transcribe and read many times the answers to understand what she wanted to transmit.","title":"Tandem Project"},{"location":"term2/CommunicatingIdeas/#session-2-30th-january","text":"","title":"Session 2 - 30th January"},{"location":"term2/CommunicatingIdeas/#personal-project_1","text":"When I start to think about the narrative of my project, what voice it has, what personality I want to give it, what actions move it?

Findings: If we had done small trials of the biomaterial, before the final one, we would not have made these mistakes. When using biomaterials it is difficult to control the time, and you have to be at the mercy of the material. You have to think about the manufacturing process and the material to be used beforehand.

I started the week with a lot of ideas in mind, with my partner Marius we thought of making a very complete artifact, which could be 100% useful for our master project. I am glad that, at that moment, I was wise enough to structure the manufacturing process of the artifact we had designed in different prioritized and independent parts. For example, there was the first block of fabrication and basic electronics (the button, the Raspberry Pi, the microphone\u2026), the second block of basic programming (making the code to record the audio and save it as a file) and the last block of more advanced programming with Artificial Intelligence (incorporating an AI-generated response and being able to play it back). These 3 blocks were clearly prioritized and we made the effort to start step by step. Thanks to that, we were able to move forward with the first and second blocks, without being able to enter the third, but still have a working prototype. The most frustrating part of the Micro Challenge, for me, was figuring out which parts of the system were acting up. For example, by the end of Thursday, we had finished the prototype and the code, everything was working. And we started testing with the AI. There was a point where the button stopped working properly and became very sensitive on the wires. That made the whole system not work. What I learned the most at that moment, is that when there is a complicated problem, you have to analyze element by element, without assuming information that you don\u2019t have. Overall, this exercise has helped me to dig a little deeper into the world of prototyping, to confirm that teamwork with marius works very well, to be able to face a little more my research for the master\u2019s project and to generate even more ideas thanks to the inspiration of my colleagues. CHALLENGE 2 \u00b6 DPD + Designing with Extended Intelligence Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga & Josep Mart\u00ed 5-8 March 2024 Here you will find our Micro Challenge repository with the documentation of the whole process we undertook that week: https://hackmd.io/vz8t1qg0T2yzbrudc_p6dw?view Reflection \u00b6 The experience of this second Micro Challenge, for me, has been completely different. At first, I felt that we had an advantage over the first Challenge from the beginning because we already knew what we were up against. My expectations of capabilities, materials, work rhythms, available resources and possible support from the teachers, were very well placed thanks to the fact that it was the second time doing a Micro Challenge. On the other hand, I was very happy to be able to continue with the project we had started a few weeks ago with Marius. The fact that we had already talked about it many times, had the time to look for references and information, to know how Marius and I work in this context\u2026 made the experience much more enjoyable and motivating. The word that could define my week in the Micro Challenge 2 is motivating. I felt very satisfied with our work and how we managed the different problems that arose and the moments of stress or helplessness. This motivation, for me, is the engine that makes me continue with the project with strength and enthusiasm, and gives me the possibility to believe in myself enough to imagine designs that I would never have thought I was capable of doing. On the other hand, the further reflection I have also includes the part of improvement that we still have left. I think that in this Micro Challenge we have not improved in terms of documentation. We did not focus on documenting every step of the process, especially the coding part, which was also new to us and would have been useful to have for the future. For the next Micro Challenge, my personal goal is to document the different mistakes and successes we make in the whole process to be able to capture it well in the repository and be useful to my future self and other people.","title":"3.1.micro challenges"},{"location":"term2/MicroChallenge/#digital-prototyping-for-design-micro-challenges","text":"","title":"Digital Prototyping for Design - Micro Challenges"},{"location":"term2/MicroChallenge/#challenge-1","text":"Prototyping together Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga & Josep Mart\u00ed 13-16 February 2024 Here you will find our Micro Challenge repository with the documentation of the whole process we undertook that week: https://github.com/marius-schairer/MicroChallenge/tree/main","title":"CHALLENGE 1"},{"location":"term2/MicroChallenge/#reflection","text":"Participating in my first Micro Challenge, for me, has been a completely new and revealing experience.

Thanks to that, we were able to move forward with the first and second blocks, without being able to enter the third, but still have a working prototype. The most frustrating part of the Micro Challenge, for me, was figuring out which parts of the system were acting up. For example, by the end of Thursday, we had finished the prototype and the code, everything was working. And we started testing with the AI. There was a point where the button stopped working properly and became very sensitive on the wires. That made the whole system not work. What I learned the most at that moment, is that when there is a complicated problem, you have to analyze element by element, without assuming information that you don\u2019t have. Overall, this exercise has helped me to dig a little deeper into the world of prototyping, to confirm that teamwork with marius works very well, to be able to face a little more my research for the master\u2019s project and to generate even more ideas thanks to the inspiration of my colleagues.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term2/MicroChallenge/#challenge-2","text":"DPD + Designing with Extended Intelligence Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga & Josep Mart\u00ed 5-8 March 2024 Here you will find our Micro Challenge repository with the documentation of the whole process we undertook that week: https://hackmd.io/vz8t1qg0T2yzbrudc_p6dw?view","title":"CHALLENGE 2"},{"location":"term2/MicroChallenge/#reflection_1","text":"The experience of this second Micro Challenge, for me, has been completely different. At first, I felt that we had an advantage over the first Challenge from the beginning because we already knew what we were up against. My expectations of capabilities, materials, work rhythms, available resources and possible support from the teachers, were very well placed thanks to the fact that it was the second time doing a Micro Challenge. On the other hand, I was very happy to be able to continue with the project we had started a few weeks ago with Marius. The fact that we had already talked about it many times, had the time to look for references and information, to know how Marius and I work in this context\u2026 made the experience much more enjoyable and motivating. The word that could define my week in the Micro Challenge 2 is motivating. I felt very satisfied with our work and how we managed the different problems that arose and the moments of stress or helplessness. This motivation, for me, is the engine that makes me continue with the project with strength and enthusiasm, and gives me the possibility to believe in myself enough to imagine designs that I would never have thought I was capable of doing. On the other hand, the further reflection I have also includes the part of improvement that we still have left. I think that in this Micro Challenge we have not improved in terms of documentation. We did not focus on documenting every step of the process, especially the coding part, which was also new to us and would have been useful to have for the future. For the next Micro Challenge, my personal goal is to document the different mistakes and successes we make in the whole process to be able to capture it well in the repository and be useful to my future self and other people.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term2/Research%20Trip/","text":"Research Trip \u00b6 Transfrontier - Angoustrine, Cerdagne, France Merc\u00e8 Rua & Johnatan Minchin 17-24 th March 2024 Reflection \u00b6 I started the trip with the idea of clarifying my doubts about my master\u2019s research. I had been tackling the urban-rural theme for a whole trimester and this opportunity, for me, was the ideal opportunity to set myself a goal: to decide whether to pursue the topic and, if so, to investigate it from a non-urban point of view. With hindsight, I failed to set such a firm and inflexible goal. I quickly saw how the Research Trip was designed for exploration, and not clear objectives from the start. The first two days, when we met the tree nursery, Maria Claire and did the excursion, were very enjoyable days but I lived with some concern that I was not \u201ctaking advantage academically\u201d. It was on the third day that I sat down with myself and started to think about the environment I was being given. At that moment it became very easy for me to let go of the firm objective I had set at the beginning and I started to think about the context in which I found myself. It was very useful to take a walk with Marius, to put myself in the physical and temporal situation of the context and to talk with my partner. It is always better to think out loud and accompanied in these cases. It also helped me to realize that I could not go out to the village to do \u201cinterviews\u201d, because there were no people in the streets and I had limited time. Finally, thanks to the invaluable help of Merc\u00e9, I managed to make a small step, something that the previous Sunday would have seemed small to me, at that moment it made sense. The visit and the conversation with Susanne was exciting for me, even a bit paralyzing. Thanks to her way of speaking, slow for me to understand, and her stories, I was able to analyze 33 minutes of audio over and over again.

Carry out your 1 st design intervention from a 1PP with your community of practice (involve yourself in the context you want to work on). Document the design intervention, analyze it and reflect on the findings. For my intervention, these weeks I have designed a paper envelope to start a community chain to gather information about what people think about the ruralization of their neighborhoods. The packet consisted of: A neighborhood map A sheet with an explanation of the project and instructions A piece of paper with questions for reflection Stickers with the corporate illustration The intervention started when I printed these packages (from 3 different neighborhoods of Barcelona) and gave them to people from these neighborhoods. The people who received the package had to open it and follow the instructions: Locate the map that you will find inside the package. Mark the areas of the neighborhood that remind you the most of rural life. Answer the questions that you will find on the small piece of paper. What values from rural communities could we incorporate in the city? What sustainable habits do you practice? Do you think the Putxet neighborhood takes care of itself? Once you have completed the activity you should send a message to my phone number (this way I can track the device) and pass the package to another person in the neighborhood that you know but is NOT your friend or family member. Reflection & results \u00b6 At the beginning of the experiment, I planned to send only 3 packages; one in each neighborhood I thought. I started the exercise by giving the packages to the people in each neighborhood. After a couple of days I saw that my expectations were too high, in 2 days I had not received any messages. After the review with Jana I decided to do a month iterations of the same exercise. In this second part, I had a hard time finding people I could trust in the 3 neighborhoods, since I wanted to send 3 more packages in each neighborhood. Since it is important that the first person has the willingness to participate and listen to me, I changed the second iteration and only applied it to my neighborhood, Putxet neighborhood. I made 2 packages of each of 3 variations of the exercise, changing the following parameters: Temporality: the instruction sheet mentioned the temporality of the exercise and, therefore, asked the participant to do it in 24 hours, or not. Friends and family: participants could pass the package to people in their close circles, or not. From each combination I printed 2 packets and used my neighborhood contacts to try to send them all. One of them never went out due to logistical circumstances, and another one was started by me. At the time of this writing, I have not yet begun the process of retrieving the packages. As far as the results are concerned, I am happy to have increased the number of packages sent, because none of them have reached more than 3 people, most of them have not advanced. As I said before, my expectations were higher, but with this iteration I will have enough information. I can conclude that the people closest to me are super open to participate in my experiments, but the farther the package moves, the less motivation and predisposition I find. This makes me think that I should take advantage of the motivation of my family and friends, instead of trying to reach a wider audience, at least for the moment. On the other hand, I am sure that a similar activity but in a digital way would have given more fruits, and that also makes me reflect. We try, as designers, to act always from a 1PP, not to fall into classic methodologies of surveys and interviews. But when talking to citizens who do not understand the language of design, are the classic methodologies better? Can it be that innovation is not inclusive, or does not reach everyone? How can classical methodologies be adapted to frame them in the 1PP? Suggestions I have received from participants: With the question \u201cDo you think the neighborhood is taken care of?\u201d, it is not clear whether it refers to the social level or the administrative level. Little space to write the answers. Specify if more than one zone can be marked. People are not receptive to participate. There is discomfort with giving the phone number to a stranger. It would be easier to pass it on to family and friends. Do I need a specific age range? People find it hard to write, audio or face to face would be better.","title":"first intervention"},{"location":"term2/Session%201/#first-session","text":"When? 22th January 2024 Who?

Questions: Sound pollution and air pollution Are the sound levels throughout the city below the healthy limit? (85 dB) Day? Night? Is the air quality at a level that is healthy to exercise outside? Sunlight and visible sky Can we decide where to go have a vermut depending on the sun? Can you walk around the streets of Bcn and get a healthy amount of sunlight? Is the sky in Barcelona visible enough to not feel caged? Illumination and street safety Are the streets of the city illuminated enough to feel safe for walkers? (Specially women) Sensorly and mobility inclusion Is the Barcelona metro sensorly inclusive? Is every part of the city reachable for everyone? (mobility & inclusion) Are the lightlevels in the metro at a level that is positive for ones mental health? Hypothesis \u00b6 There is not enough connection to the natural sky in Barcelona. Tips \u00b6 Try and focus on one area instead of all the things at once Focus on things you are passionate about as it will be easier to research and spend time on Hypothesis -> Data \u00b6 Tools selection \u00b6 We fighted for the Raspberry Pi Camera for our exercise. We plan to gather data about the direct sunlight that the streets of Barcelona get, to find a way to navigate through the city in a healthier way, wether is gettinf vitamin D from the sun during the winter, or avoiding the sun rays during the summer. We consider a camera is very important for our exercise because we don\u2019t want to measure the temperature or the light level, but we want to see what areas of the sidewalks are in contact with sunlight. We though about alternatives, when we were discussing with other groups, and found some ways to change our exercise, through a physical action for example, but we still think the camera is the one that fits us the most. Tool usage documentation \u00b6 How can others replicate your data capturing process again? Our data capturing process is easyly replicable. They would need to gather the materials, preferably 1 Raspberry Pi camera and 5 smartphones, and divide the group on the following areas of Barcelona to do the exercise: Sagrada Familia, Eixample Esquerra, Putxet, Ciutat Vella, Sant Mart\u00ed and El Clot/Poblenou. Data capturing strategy \u00b6 We decided to take advantage of the little time we had to collect as much data as possible, but we only had a Raspberry Pi camera. To make the best use of the exercise, we decided to use the cameras of our phones, so we could capture more images simultaneously. Each of us had to complete the following actions: Take 10 pictures of 10 different streets in our neighborhood during the day. Take 10 pictures of 10 different streets in our neighborhood during the night. In this way, being 6 in the group, we managed to collect 120 images with relevant information for our exercise. Materials needed \u00b6 Raspberry Pi Camera (only one person used it) 5 smartphone cameras (the rest of the group) Detail setup instructions (Raspberry Pi Camera) \u00b6 Insert an micro sd card into your computer and load Raspberry OS on it Connect the Raspberry Pi to a power source (powerbank, wall outlet through a 5V charger) Connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor and a keyboard ( this will make it easier to do the next few steps ) When the Pi has booted up completely,you will be prompted to login with the username and password you set up during step 1. You can begin the process of connecting it to a wireless network. ( If using a mobile hotspot as the wireless network and you are using an iPhone, make sure that the \u201cmaximise compatibility\u201d feature is turned on in your hotspot settings. If you are using an android device it should be fine.This is because older models of the raspberry pi cannot connect to a 5G network natively. ) In the terminal interface of the Pi run the command \u201csudo raspi-config\u201d, this will bring up the raspberry pi configuration window. Navigate to and select the wireless configuration option. Connect to a Wireless Network ~ You will be prompted to enter the name of your wireless network, hit \u201cEnter\u201d then enter your network\u2019s password nad hit \u201cEnter\u201d. You should now be connected to the WiFi network. From the terminal inside the Raspberry Pi OS you need to install the RPi-Cam-Web-Interface. You can follow the instructions to do so here Once you\u2019ve installed this interface, you can move on to the next steps To check that your pi has connected to your desired network, install a network scanning software like Advanced ip scanner Run this program, and start scanning your network for IP addresses connected to the network.

Congratulations! You are now set up and ready to take pictures with your raspberry pi and camera. :D Data collected \u00b6 Daytime photos Nightime photos Tips \u00b6 Try and focus on the same time frame for each pictures to get a better result Take more time to specify on different areas at different timeframes to get wider range of data Explore a wider range of areas to get a completer set of data Data -> Information \u00b6 Data summary \u00b6 Brightness levels depending on the neighbourhood \u00b6 To analyze the data we used a variety of methods. The first one we did was using a python code to create grayscale images and then score the brightness between 0 (darkness) and 255(ultimate brightness). Images Taken Code Used Data Used It is important to say that as the eixample images were shot with the raspberry pi the quality and light could potentially be different then the images shot with the phone and cameras. These images were then exported into a csv file and used to create the following graphs. Average brightness in each neighbourhood at day and night Brightness per situation per neighbourhood The next graphs created were scatterplots of each neighbourhood using the data collected during day and night to see the relative brightness of each picture at different times of day. Lighting Maps Using Found Data vs Collected Data \u00b6 Using the data we collected about the light at night and the average levels in each neighbourhood we mapped the level of light pollution that could be found. (With this map the whiter the yellow the color the more light pollution) We then went and looked for more opensource data that we could use to create a better map that takes more factors into account then just the small sample we had. The data we used was LightPollutionMap Comparison between real data recolected by us, and SketchUp shadow plug in \u00b6 Learning Outcomes \u00b6 Conclusion of the Results \u00b6 With the data we have recollected and the information already existing in the shadow SketchUp plug in (having previously compared and verified that they are true), we have designed a reccomended route for people living in Ciutat Vella, Eixample and Sagrada Familia to have a healthy 20 minute walk in the sun that will: Vitamin D synthesis: Sunlight is a natural source of vitamin D, and exposure to sunlight triggers the synthesis of this essential vitamin in the skin. Vitamin D is crucial for bone health, immune function, and overall well-being. Mood improvement: Sunlight exposure stimulates the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness. Sunlight exposure is associated with improved mood and can help alleviate symptoms of conditions like seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Increased energy levels: Sunlight exposure can boost energy levels and reduce feelings of fatigue. The combination of fresh air and natural light during a walk can invigorate and rejuvenate the body. Better sleep: Exposure to natural light during the day helps regulate the body\u2019s circadian rhythm, promoting better sleep quality. This can positively impact overall health and well-being. Physical activity: A 20-minute walk provides a moderate form of exercise that contributes to cardiovascular health, improved circulation, and weight management. Regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits, including reduced risk of chronic diseases. Stress reduction: Spending time outdoors, especially in natural settings, has been linked to stress reduction. The combination of sunlight, fresh air, and nature can have a calming effect on the mind and body. Improved concentration and focus: Physical activity and exposure to sunlight have been shown to enhance cognitive function. Taking a short walk in the sun may help improve concentration and mental clarity. Enhanced immune function: Adequate vitamin D levels, obtained through sunlight exposure, play a role in supporting a healthy immune system. A well-functioning immune system is crucial for defending the body against infections and illnesses. Tips \u00b6 One thing we could improve in the future is using the same tool for all the images. The initial plan was to use the Pi to take most of the pictures in the neighbourhood and suplement those with photos from phones when needed. The setup took much longer than we expected, so we chose to mostly rely on our phone cameras which led to images that varied in quality more then if one single camera had been used with the same settings. We learned that collecting data means needing to adjust to different set backs and reflecting on which ways your data might differ then the plan. Future explorations \u00b6 Build an interface similar to Google Maps, that could reccomend healthier routes for people navigating the city depending on: Direct sunlight contact (the one we explored) Visiblility of the sky Sound pollution levels Air pollution levels Street illumination and street safety Sensorly inclusivity Taking data from already built networks in the city like Smart Citizen or other similar projects. As an inspiration, we have found a similar project that modeled direct sunlight and shades and developed a tool that creates optimal routes for heat prevention: seeking shady sidewalks, drinking fountains or places to take shelter. https://cool.bcnregional.com/ Presentation \u00b6 Final reflection \u00b6","title":"5.measuring the world"},{"location":"term2/measuring%20the%20world/#measuring-the-world","text":"Oscar Gonzalez, Adau Surinach & Guillem Camprodon 7-9 February 2024","title":"Measuring the World"},{"location":"term2/measuring%20the%20world/#sense-making-journal-healthier-city-navigation","text":"MDEF: Measuring the world / A world in data activity report.

We explored how our daily movements could be translated into sound. Imagine if your music was influenced by your walking speed. Training the Model \u00b6 From Movement to Data The initial step involved capturing data from the phone, such as room position, GPS, and speed, and sending it to Wekinator. Once in Wekinator, we trained our model to differentiate between walking (0) and running (1). In a previous module, Citlali introduced us to a mobile app called \u201cZIG Sim,\u201d which allows access to various phone sensors, including the accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, and camera. This app can send sensor data via OSC messaging (among other methods) to another device for processing. Using this, we had Mars run and walk around the room with the phone in his pocket. However, we quickly realized the room was too small to collect accurate data, so we moved the training to the roof for a larger, straighter space to gather more precise data. Although we wanted to investigate more types of movement, time constraints limited our focus to this aspect. Steps Taken The process from training to the final output was straightforward but required navigating through various software and interactions. Once the basics were understood, numerous opportunities emerged. The project\u2019s goal was to explore: \u201cWhat if the songs you listened to changed based on whether you were running or not?\u201d Grabbing Data from Phone using ZIG Sim Data Collection with ZIG Sim: We used the ZIG Sim app on a phone to collect various data points, focusing on GPS, acceleration, and placement in the Z-axis. The data was then sent to Wekinator. To account for differences in individual movement, we trained the model on multiple people running and walking. Training the Model in Wekinator Model Training: While collecting data from the phone, we simultaneously sent it to the Wekinator application on a laptop. In Wekinator, we trained the model to recognize that running corresponds to a signal of 1 and walking corresponds to a signal of 0. Sending Data to Max8 Connecting to Max8: After completing the training in Wekinator, we connected the model to Max8. The model was configured to send a signal of either 0 or 1 based on the movement data. Converting Received Input to Sound in Max8 Sound Conversion in Max8: Using the received signal, we created a simple flow of code in Max8. This code switched between two sounds based on whether the signal was 0 or 1, effectively changing the music based on whether the user was walking or running. Result \u00b6 In the end, we successfully created a model and code that enabled us to translate a person\u2019s running or walking into a corresponding song. It was exciting to see this in action because it suggests new ways for people to interact with their own movement, potentially enhancing experiences in dancing, running, or other sports.

I discovered new apps and technologies like ZIG Sim, Wekinator or Max8 Feelings: I feel like having an unrelated delivery from our project at tjis stage was a bit distracting but also satisfying, for being able to disconnect from what we are doing and do a completely different task. Findings: Sensors are not as complicated as I imagined and they have very fun and unexpected applications. Future: I don\u2019t plan on researching more on this topic in the near future but I\u2019ve enjoyed doing it now and I don\u2019t dicard it in the long run.","title":"4.digital prototyping"},{"location":"term3/DigitalProto/#digital-prototyping-for-design","text":"","title":"Digital Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term3/DigitalProto/#module-4-5","text":"Sensing the body for meaningful interactions + Extended bodies with expressive Data Lina Bautista & Citlali Hern\u00e1ndez 23-30 April 2024","title":"Module 4 &amp; 5"},{"location":"term3/DigitalProto/#task-prototype-your-wearable-and-experiment-with-your-training-model","text":"by N\u00faria, Marius & Oliver This digital prototyping session centered on utilizing either our custom device or another form of movement tracking to generate artistic outputs.

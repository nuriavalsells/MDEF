I\u2019m a 24-year-old from Barcelona who graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Industrial Design and Product Development Engineering from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya. After graduation, I began working at Azimut 360, a non-profit cooperative dedicated to the engineering and installation of photovoltaic systems, both nationally and internationally. However, I soon realized that my interests extended far beyond designing everyday objects and products in a more elegant, aesthetic way. I wanted to use my skills to make a positive impact on society. That\u2019s why I pursued a Master\u2019s degree in Social Design. Through my studies, I have expanded my knowledge and vision of industrial design as a tool for transforming everything that is already established. From industrial and manufacturing processes to the most everyday objects that perpetuate attitudes in society that need to change in order to move forward. I spent 1 year taking a Master in Social Design at NABA (Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti) in Milan, Italy. It was a very interesting year, I learned a lot from my teachers and collegues and I got to participate in meaningful projects that motivated me a lot. When I started, this last September, the second course of the Master, I realized that the second year wasn\u2019t gonna fufill my expectations and the experience wasn\u2019t motivating enough for me. The 15 th of October I made the decision to move back to Barcelona and start the Master in Design for Emergent Futures. So far, I\u2019m very happy with my decision and I think it will bring me a lot of positive things, while living again in my beloved Barcelona <3.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#get-to-know-me","text":"Hello, my name is N\u00faria Valsells Vilalta, and I\u2019m excited to introduce you to my MDEF documenation page.

For that day I had done the work of creating my Atlas of Weak Signals, my Multiscalar Personal Design Space and my (not so) Final Design Space. We started off talking about the firsts two, at first it was my turn to explain what I had done, what are my interests and opportunities\u2026 It was difficult for me to justify every single element in the Final Design Space, I realized I had done it guiding my self with impulses instead of rationally thinking. I don\u2019t think this is necessarily a bad thing, but I regret doing it like this because I felt like the Design Space was a bit shallow. The talk with Jana helped me realize I had to go deeper into my interests and my directions, even if these were too many for the project. I\u2019m looking forward to starting a mini research on this to finally map my Design Space and then start deciding what I can and want to focus on. After the session I set for myself, as personal homework, to modify the Design Space adding elements and relating them better between them. 06th november, with Roger \u00b6 My second Design Studio review was with Roger last Monday. The session was very helpful to validate how I felt about my own Design Space.I feel that I am still a bit lost with the Design Space topics, but lost in a good way. I have too big a space that encompasses too many topics, each one of them in itself is already too big. With Roger we discussed that I will have to start focusing the seminars and activities of the weeks in order to figure out which side I want to focus on. Use the exercises and projects to learn about my own Design Space. Following this, we went through a list I made of action or Individual Interventions that I could do myself in my day to day life to explore the different themes of the Design Space and start eliminating things in it. My next goal is to reduce the design space based on what really interests me. Important note: Roger is encouraging me to take advantage of my \u201cprivilege\u201d of being from Barcelona to complete the Design Space with references and resources that I already know and can reach. 20 th november, with Jana \u00b6 The review I had with Jana last monday I liked because it was the first one in which we didn\u2019t focus on the Design Space. Sometimes it is more useful for me to have a calm conversation about my interests and my thoughts than to focus, alone, on the tool that the Design Space becomes. With Jana we talked about the intervention we had designed the previous hours in class. With my group we had drawn a conceptual map of interests and thanks to the review I realized that, in reality, I was only interested in a part of that map.

While the topic didn\u2019t fully align with my core interests, I found myself more engaged when the discussion shifted towards rural communities, their connection with nature, and the exploration of ancient methods. These aspects added a layer of relevance and intrigue to the subject matter for me. However, the broad nature of the class left me wanting more depth in a specific area. It felt like a surface exploration, and I yearn to delve deeper into a particular aspect. Despite the overall general nature of the seminar not resonating with me entirely, I did find pockets of interest that I\u2019m keen to explore further on a more focused level. One highlight was the visit to Valldaura, where I was captivated by the concept presented. The integration of sustainable practices and the potential for collaboration piqued my interest.

Mosquitoes, especially certain species, can transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus and chikungunya. These diseases are more severe in poor areas and can lead to many illnesses and, unfortunately, even death. Mosquitoes are everywhere, and factors such as urban expansion and climate change are making the problem worse. Possible solutions: Reduce the spread of disease Disease resistant plants Predatory insects that kill disease carriers Organisms with similar functions in nature: Naturally Resistant Plants: Plants that naturally exhibit resistance to insect-borne diseases. Predatory insects in ecosystems: understanding the mechanisms of population control of natural enemies of disease-carrying insects. Property Recipient: Wild mosquito populations: Wild mosquito populations are genetically modified to reduce their ability to transmit disease. Crop varieties: Implement disease resistance measures on key crop varieties to protect agricultural yields. Predatory insects in urban environments: Enhancing natural enemies of disease-carrying insects to control their populations in urban areas. Other ecological balance considerations: We need to ensure that the introduction of modified organisms does not disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem. References \u00b6 I wanted to include some GMO projects I\u2019ve found while doing the deliverable: Hy-Fi\u201d by The Living: The architectural design studio The Living, which is part of Autodesk, created a temporary installation known as \u201cHy-Fi\u201d at MoMA PS1 in New York. The structure was made of biodegradable bricks composed of corn stalks and living mycelium (a type of fungus). The living mycelium bricks were used to construct a tower that responded to environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, by changing its properties over time. BioUrban\u201d by Urban Greening: While not furniture, the BioUrban project by Urban Greening is an example of using microorganisms to improve urban environments. BioUrban is a vertical garden system that uses microalgae to capture carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. It can be applied to urban structures like buildings and highways to help purify the air in cities. \u201cMoss Carpet\u201d by Nguyen La Chanh: While not furniture in the traditional sense, the \u201cMoss Carpet\u201d is an example of living design. Vietnamese designer Nguyen La Chanh created a bath mat made of moss that thrives on the humidity of a bathroom. The moss mat is a functional and decorative piece that incorporates living organisms into the design. \u201cBiological Wall\u201d by EcoLogic Studio: The architectural design firm EcoLogic Studio has developed the \u201cUrban Greening\u201d project, which includes the \u201cBioUrban\u201d system mentioned earlier. They\u2019ve also designed biological walls, known as \u201cH.O.R.T.U.S. XL Astaxanthin.g.\u201d These living installations combine microalgae and real-time data monitoring to create an ever-changing and self-regulating environment.

The prospect of incorporating biology into my future projects seemed incidental, and I figured I could manage by reaching out to experts if needed. However, despite my low interest in the subject matter, I realized the significance of staying updated on scientific developments. This realization was sparked by Nuria\u2019s class, where the coverage of current scientific news caught my attention and became an aspect I found extremely intriguing. Moreover, I developed a newfound appreciation for the concept of using nature as a toolbox, especially in the realm of design. The idea of drawing inspiration and solutions from the natural world resonated with me. Even though the specific topic of the seminar may not have deeply captivated me, the broader perspective of staying informed about scientific advancements and embracing nature as a source of innovation left a lasting impression. It made me consider the broader implications and applications of these ideas beyond the immediate context of the seminar, potentially influencing my approach to future projects.","title":"biology zero"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#biology-zero","text":"Nuria Conde 7-9 November 2023","title":"Biology zero"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#contents","text":"The week we took the Biology Zero class with Nuria we were fortunate to make an experiment thet consisted in cultivating microbes. 1.Build our own medium to host the microbes 2.Sterilize the container with the medium in a pressure cooker and vert the medium into a, also sterile, petri dish. 3.Go \u201chunting\u201d for microbes with the petri dishes 4.After 1 day in the incubator at 25\u00baC, some colonies are formed and we can observe them through the microscope","title":"Contents"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#deliverable","text":"","title":"Deliverable"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#design-idea","text":"Issue: Transmission of insect-borne diseases The global problem of mosquito-borne diseases is a major health concern affecting many people around the world.

Property Recipient: Wild mosquito populations: Wild mosquito populations are genetically modified to reduce their ability to transmit disease. Crop varieties: Implement disease resistance measures on key crop varieties to protect agricultural yields. Predatory insects in urban environments: Enhancing natural enemies of disease-carrying insects to control their populations in urban areas. Other ecological balance considerations: We need to ensure that the introduction of modified organisms does not disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem.","title":"Design Idea"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#references","text":"I wanted to include some GMO projects I\u2019ve found while doing the deliverable: Hy-Fi\u201d by The Living: The architectural design studio The Living, which is part of Autodesk, created a temporary installation known as \u201cHy-Fi\u201d at MoMA PS1 in New York. The structure was made of biodegradable bricks composed of corn stalks and living mycelium (a type of fungus). The living mycelium bricks were used to construct a tower that responded to environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, by changing its properties over time. BioUrban\u201d by Urban Greening: While not furniture, the BioUrban project by Urban Greening is an example of using microorganisms to improve urban environments. BioUrban is a vertical garden system that uses microalgae to capture carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. It can be applied to urban structures like buildings and highways to help purify the air in cities. \u201cMoss Carpet\u201d by Nguyen La Chanh: While not furniture in the traditional sense, the \u201cMoss Carpet\u201d is an example of living design. Vietnamese designer Nguyen La Chanh created a bath mat made of moss that thrives on the humidity of a bathroom. The moss mat is a functional and decorative piece that incorporates living organisms into the design. \u201cBiological Wall\u201d by EcoLogic Studio: The architectural design firm EcoLogic Studio has developed the \u201cUrban Greening\u201d project, which includes the \u201cBioUrban\u201d system mentioned earlier. They\u2019ve also designed biological walls, known as \u201cH.O.R.T.U.S. XL Astaxanthin.g.\u201d These living installations combine microalgae and real-time data monitoring to create an ever-changing and self-regulating environment.","title":"References"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#bibliography","text":"Beisel.U, B\u00f6ete.C.

The prospect of incorporating biology into my future projects seemed incidental, and I figured I could manage by reaching out to experts if needed. However, despite my low interest in the subject matter, I realized the significance of staying updated on scientific developments. This realization was sparked by Nuria\u2019s class, where the coverage of current scientific news caught my attention and became an aspect I found extremely intriguing. Moreover, I developed a newfound appreciation for the concept of using nature as a toolbox, especially in the realm of design. The idea of drawing inspiration and solutions from the natural world resonated with me. Even though the specific topic of the seminar may not have deeply captivated me, the broader perspective of staying informed about scientific advancements and embracing nature as a source of innovation left a lasting impression. It made me consider the broader implications and applications of these ideas beyond the immediate context of the seminar, potentially influencing my approach to future projects.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term1/Design%20Studio/","text":"The Design Studio class is a transversal semniar that will go on during the whole year. MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives..

At first with a presentation from Markel about Holon and the context we were gonna work with the next days. But mostly, Markel introduced to us the concept of \u201cSoil\u201d and what it entails, for example: the microorganisms living in and out of soil, the issue of waste and soil contamination, a cultural sense of the soil as in the history and traditions it holds, the different technologies and methods to manage soil or the worldwide food transport system. All of these topics are related to one another going through the concept of \u201csoil\u201d. As a second part of that first class we had an assignment to fulfill. We had to explore 100 m2 of soil that Markel had not delimited and do a research on the conflicts/problems that we detected. As a representation of this research, we had to create an installation to tell what we had discovered. In my case, when I started to explore the area I saw many conflicts that could interest me but I decided to focus on the soil as a literal concept. I spent 20 minutes walking around the area, just observing how the soil changed, with my eyes fixed on it. I detected that there were many textures and colors in that soil, and the interesting thing is that I detected that there were groups of textures and colors, and those groups were also associated to different sounds. To represent my research, I made a very simple video with the textures, colors and sounds that I detected with my mobile phone. Land \u00b6 La Borda visit The second day started with a visit to La Borda building. Adri\u00e0 gave us a very detailed tour of all the spaces in the building, he even generously invited us to visit his house. The interesting part of the visit was the explanation of the project behind the La Borda building. La Borda is the first cooperative housing in Spain and is built on a land in cession of use. I think it is appropriate to recommend the 30 minutes documentary about the project. https://www.ccma.cat/3cat/t1xc3-lacol/video/6247592/ With the visit we realized the importance of politics in the design and the possibilities that we have within reach and we do not always see. That second day was dedicated to the concept of \u201cLand\u201d, and with the beginning in La Borda it was clear to us from the beginning that land is not only a natural element, it also has social, political and cultural connotations. After we had replenished ourselves with so much information we proceeded to have meetings with the groups that we had created the day before and started to think about areas of real interest that we all had and to do research on organizations that are currently working in these areas or communities that might be interested in collaborating. In my case, the group I was part of, we were very interested in the biodiversity of the city, the coexistence between species and the use of architecture/design to re-integrate the animal world into the urban world. Visits \u00b6 Makers Zone BCN visit The initiative aims to be \u201caccessible to anyone\u201d and to stimulate community engagement, becoming a reference point for diverse creative activities. The association behind the project consists of individuals with varied interests, ranging from cosplay and decoration to carpentry, forging, and laser work. The goal is to establish a versatile maker space where anyone can participate and promote traditional craftsmanship. To use the tools, individuals need to become members and pay a monthly fee, and the space also offers stable workstations, resembling a coworking environment but with noise, smells, and people constantly engaging in creative activities.

As the fifth facility in the Ateneus Network of Barcelona, its mission is to promote creativity and innovation through socio-technological development projects using design and art methodologies, with a specific focus on digital literacy, craftsmanship, textiles, fashion, and biomaterials. The space is equipped with software and manufacturing machines that empower the community to transform ideas into tangible products for present and future societal needs.

Deliverable \u00b6 We spent the last two days of the seminar in our class at IaaC and in groups trying to reach the final goal of the seminar: assembling all the different concepts and learnings about soil and land, our personal interest and the surrounding communities to design a future community intervention, taking also care of the community engagement and the whole process it takes to finally design product/service\u2026 Group: Vania, Marcus, Carmen, Carlotta, Oliver, Everardo and N\u00faria Goal: Potentiate the integration of biodiversity in Carrer d\u2019\u00c0laba, Poblenou, Barcelona. Communities: Nest City Lab (indoor garden/coffe shop/cultural space) & BAM (Associai\u00f3 Bioarquitectura Meditarr\u00e0nea) As a final delivery we came up with a community engagement plan to reach the goal we had set. The objective of the plan is to engage both Nest City Lab and BAM into a collaborative process with us to reimagine the street they share and come up with designs to potentiate and promote the stree\u2019s biodiversity of pollinating species. While tracing the plan, we soon realized that the issue wasn\u2019y which design we ahd to come up with to solve the biodiversity of the street, but how could we generate interest on the topic in the community so they would be motivated to participate. Our plan doesn\u2019t include a final producte design, it includes little actins/interventions that are meant to collaborate with the communities. The first plart of the plan consists of a communication campaign, so we tried to design some of the posters that would be part of the campaign. Finally, we made a video to illustrate how bees feel in the street. While emboding the bee figure in our intervention area, we became even more aware of the problem and confirmed our initials assumptions. You will find our whole thinking process in this Miro Board: Final Reflection \u00b6 Thinking about the project where we worked on making Carrer d\u2019\u00c0laba in Barcelona more biodiverse, I had some good and not-so-good feelings about it. What Went Well: Teamwork: It was nice working with different people. Everyone had their own ideas, and it was interesting to see how we could put them all together. Focus on Community: Instead of just coming up with a final design, we decided to get the community involved. We wanted people to care about making their street more full of life, especially for pollinators like bees. Small Actions Instead of Big Designs: We chose to do small things with the community instead of just making one big thing. This way, we could keep working with the community and not just finish a project and leave. What Could Have Been Better: Not Enough Time: The biggest problem was that we didn\u2019t have enough time. Making a whole plan for the community in just a week was tough. More time would have helped us think deeper. Missing Theoretical Learning: I wish we had learned more theory about the problems we were trying to solve. Understanding more about biodiversity and community engagement would have made our plan stronger. Need for Examples: It would have been great to see examples of other projects like ours. Seeing what worked in other places could have given us good ideas. Final Thoughts: I liked the project, but having more time and learning more theory would have made it better. Also, looking at other projects could have given us cool ideas. I learned that making a community care about something is more important than just making something for them. In the future, I hope we have more time for projects and learn more about the theories behind what we\u2019re doing.","title":"design with others"},{"location":"term1/Design%20with%20others/#design-with-others","text":"Adri\u00e0 Garcia i Mateu, Markel Cormenzana & Milena Calvo Juarez 21-24 November 2023","title":"Design with others"},{"location":"term1/Design%20with%20others/#contents","text":"","title":"Contents"},{"location":"term1/Design%20with%20others/#soil","text":"The first day we met at C\u00f2opolis, in Can Batll\u00f3 to start the more theoretical part of the day.

This method is a new way for designers and creators to experiment their own design research on themselves (their body, their environment, theirs interests, theirs tools\u2026) The method says that we can use our own bodies to explore, to communicate, to research. This allows us to take the design process to another level, to analyze our whole body. When involving the body into the design process you relate the product you design with the experience your body lives. FPP allows us to be situated as actors in environments and generate change. Acknowledging situated and partial knowledge, creating interactive, transversal and open-ended RtD. Involving yourself into the design process also brings all kinds of knowledge. It\u2019s the responsibility of the designer to entangle it into the process (culture, history, values, identity, ways of working\u2026). At the same time, you also bring all of your skills. Involving yourself is also a political act because you decide what to do and what not to do. The mix makes the design unique for yourself. FPP allows different temporalities to coexist in the same process. You create past, present and futures with your experience, imagination and memory. You bring your roots, your whole brain. At the end of the day, the goal of the First Person Perspective is to support affirmative creativity; avoid thinking what is right or wrong, instead analyze how the project/prototype impacts myself while testing it in my everyday life. Deliverables \u00b6 Create a companion \u00b6 The first deliverable of the seminar consists of a rapid lo-fi prototyping of a personal companion that wants to adress a topic of your live. In my case, i decided to create a \u201cDo You Want a Hug Machine\u201d to represent my relationship with the concept of love. Although my heart is internally a mess and doesn\u2019t know what it wants, a simple gesture as a hug will satisfy it momentarily. First Person Perspective Design Intervention \u00b6 How does it feel to be out of context in Barcelona? Is Barcelona welcoming to non-local people? I decided to buy 24h Bus Turistic pass in Barcelona and spend a day moving around only with this transport. It has 2 lines of bus, I have a stop next to my house but Iaac is not very well communicated. By blending into the touristic bus i want to observe my own city with other eyes and see how i react when i place myself into an unknown context in my own city. Bus Turistic from Nuria Valsells i Vilalta on Vimeo . The experience started from Iaac, Thursday November 2 nd , when I embarked on the journey to get to the tourist bus to get back home. It took me 2 hours to get home, I had to stop to change lines and I forced myself to listen to the audio guide the whole way. At first, it felt a bit challenging to adapt to the new mode of transportation since I\u2019m so accustomed to the public one but once i got the the station i just had to buy my tickets, that\u2019s when I felt shy to speak catalan in such an \u201cinternational\u201d environment, it also felt like the workers who attended me were also surprised. As the touristic bus journey continued through the streets of Barcelona, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the people around us were often indifferent, ignoring our presence. This provoked a weird feeling in me, even more when it was mixed with the perspective from above, almost like watching a movie, providing a strange viewpoint for urban sightseeing.

While I did appreciate this aspect, I found the overall experience a bit boring. Reflection \u00b6 Things that could have been done better or differently: Do an action that better reflects the tourist experience in Barcelona: the Tourist Bus maybe isn\u2019t the most effective way to see Barcelona from a tourist perspective, I\u2019ll keep in mind to explore other ways to pursue this goal. Do it more times: it would be interesting to see how the experience changes when it\u2019s repeated more than once. Interact more with people: during the action i was completely a sponge, i didn\u2019t intend to interact with anyone or anything actively, i wonder how this would change the experience. Reflections: Separate myself from the action: I initially wanted to change my view of Barcelona and see the city from completely different eyes. While I was on the bus I found myself trying to force another gaze of the city and failing at it, this caused a bit of frustration. What I realized after that, is that I cannot separate who I am in my own actions, so I have to be conscious about it and accept this mixture between the event and my person. I will always be biased, as the more conscious I am about, the more coherent I will be with my actions and results. Test before imposing: after the action took place, I realized that if I\u2019d had to design a similar action for someone else, maybe I would\u2019ve made it more complex and effective (collect data in a more precise way, join more than one action in a period of time, involve 3 rd parties\u2026) but at the same time, probably, less adequate for the \u201cuser\u201d or the person doing it. It made me go slower and easier on the process, be more patient on what is worth discarding and what is worth my attention. I tend to be fast, impatient, effective, resolutive\u2026 This method is making me slow down and appreciate what I would probably miss if I designed as I\u2019ve always designed. What now?: When I was doing a brainstorm to decide what action I would take, I came up with a pretty long list of possibilities that relate somehow to my design space. Even though for logistic reasons I had to choose one, I still have the list and I plan on doing some of the interventions I thought of.","title":"living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"Oscar Tomico, Kristina Andersen & Angella Mackay 31-2 November 2023","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#content","text":"The \u201cLiving With Your Own Ideas\u201d seminar is focused on the First Person Perspective Design Research. This method is a new way for designers and creators to experiment their own design research on themselves (their body, their environment, theirs interests, theirs tools\u2026) The method says that we can use our own bodies to explore, to communicate, to research. This allows us to take the design process to another level, to analyze our whole body. When involving the body into the design process you relate the product you design with the experience your body lives. FPP allows us to be situated as actors in environments and generate change. Acknowledging situated and partial knowledge, creating interactive, transversal and open-ended RtD. Involving yourself into the design process also brings all kinds of knowledge. It\u2019s the responsibility of the designer to entangle it into the process (culture, history, values, identity, ways of working\u2026). At the same time, you also bring all of your skills. Involving yourself is also a political act because you decide what to do and what not to do. The mix makes the design unique for yourself. FPP allows different temporalities to coexist in the same process. You create past, present and futures with your experience, imagination and memory. You bring your roots, your whole brain. At the end of the day, the goal of the First Person Perspective is to support affirmative creativity; avoid thinking what is right or wrong, instead analyze how the project/prototype impacts myself while testing it in my everyday life.","title":"Content"},{"location":"term1/Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#deliverables","text":"","title":"Deliverables"},{"location":"term1/Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#create-a-companion","text":"The first deliverable of the seminar consists of a rapid lo-fi prototyping of a personal companion that wants to adress a topic of your live.

Is Barcelona welcoming to non-local people? I decided to buy 24h Bus Turistic pass in Barcelona and spend a day moving around only with this transport. It has 2 lines of bus, I have a stop next to my house but Iaac is not very well communicated. By blending into the touristic bus i want to observe my own city with other eyes and see how i react when i place myself into an unknown context in my own city. Bus Turistic from Nuria Valsells i Vilalta on Vimeo . The experience started from Iaac, Thursday November 2 nd , when I embarked on the journey to get to the tourist bus to get back home. It took me 2 hours to get home, I had to stop to change lines and I forced myself to listen to the audio guide the whole way. At first, it felt a bit challenging to adapt to the new mode of transportation since I\u2019m so accustomed to the public one but once i got the the station i just had to buy my tickets, that\u2019s when I felt shy to speak catalan in such an \u201cinternational\u201d environment, it also felt like the workers who attended me were also surprised. As the touristic bus journey continued through the streets of Barcelona, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the people around us were often indifferent, ignoring our presence. This provoked a weird feeling in me, even more when it was mixed with the perspective from above, almost like watching a movie, providing a strange viewpoint for urban sightseeing. Even though the route I was taking was no different than the one I take everyday, the slower pace of the touristic bus allowed me to discover new restaurants and shops that I had previously overlooked.

Roger Guilemany and Jana Tothill What? Areas of Intervention in a Multiscalar Design Space Contents \u00b6 We were introduced with the concept of Design Intervention. What can a design intervention be? Can and should be developed with others in context - An opportunity to co-create and iterate prototypes with others An experience that transforms yourself and others - open your mind to new scopes An action to start building trust - the first step to human relationships is trust in order to be able to co-create Am activity to bring difficult topics to the table - safe space An experience to learn and from others An experience to learn through a situated action - understanding the context that will allow us to propose something. To understand the direction that one\u2019s trying to take in the project. Relationship between Design Intervention and Design Space The Design Intervention will allow us to show the context that the Design Space is mapping so that we can create iterations of the Design Space diagram and investigate new elements in it. A Design Intervention doesn\u2019t have to be perfect or unique, is a key part of a process that consists in several actions that will lead us to build the final design space (if it ever exists). A Design Intervention can be used to understand issues we don\u2019t control, to clear our minds about them, to research unknown paths or to validate already existing ones. The four key roles a Design Intervention can have within a Design Space are: \u2794 Organizational: to visualize the ideas we have in a Design Space \u2794 Narrative: to give a voice to these ideas, so we can understand their process and development \u2794 Performative or Participative: to involve stakeholders or make it understand to the public \u2794 Inspirational: to research new developments and continue the journey Exercise A. Start sharing the elements we have printed in a big board and relate them to the ones everyone brought. B. In groups, create a Collective Design Space According to the Collective Design Space Mural we assembeled a group with similar interests. My group was formed by Annna, Everardo, Francisca and Drishya. Together we talked about our areas of interest and came up with a group Collective Design Space. C. Think about a Design Intervention to make within the shared interests and Design Space. Finally, after exploring many options we decided to conduct the following Design Intervention: We\u2019ve designed a collective Design Intervention to explore how alterations of your face can change your perception of yourself; either hide a part of you or enhance it. We want to give the possibility of changing your face to a specific group of people, and allow them to reflect on reconfiguration of the body. This change they can apply to their faces, might be on purpose to hide a part they don\u2019t like or either enhance another one they love. For the intervention, we have organized an event or party at Everardo\u2019s house with our friends. We believe that the relaxed atmosphere of this type of space gives the participant more room to get carried away. Our intervention wants to explore the following questions: - Did you choose to alter your face to hide or change a part of yourself you don\u2019t like? Or to enhace your existing identity? - After changing your face, do you feel more like yourself or less like yourself? Reflection \u00b6 Reflection on the Collective Design Space \u00b6 Doing the Collective Design Space was a bit overwhelming for me at first. From having to place my cards to, then, looking at the whole wall once it was finished. The concept of not having a right/wrong reasons to place your concepts disturbed me a little bit, but I soon went along with it. Once I looked at the wall I also felt a bit overwhelmed, so I quickly focused on a specific area of it, the one that interested me the most. Even though I choose an area of the wall, I was interested in all the groups that were formed, every topic chosen could\u2019ve fit in my own interests. Despite that, I decided to go with a group that was doing something different from what I\u2019m used to, so that I could explore more other options. Reflection on the group work \u00b6 The group work was very intense from the beginning, we choose an area of the Collective Design Space that was very plural, it had a lot of topics, and we couldn\u2019t do all of them. That\u2019s why we spent quite a bit of time, at first, to figure out what everybody was interested in and what direction we could take. It was a difficult conversation for all of us because we all wanted to compromise for the group but still be interested on the topic. After a few meeting, we kind of figured it out, and then it was time to think about the intervention. The design of the intervention wasn\u2019t easy either, but we got the hang of it as soon as we decided the goal we wanted to reach: explore how alterations of one\u2019s face can change the perception of oneself. At the beginning, we thought about playing with face prosthetics or deformations, while also exploring the identity of a community as a concept. Our main idea was to build some face prosthetics and introduce ourselves to a small Ball Room community in Barcelona to do the intervention. We soon realized we didn\u2019t have the time and resources to deliver this kind of intervention, and we had to tone it down a few knots to make it fit into our context. The final result of our intervention left aside the research of a community\u2019s identity and focused more on the perception of altering your own face. It has been good reflecting on the whole process we\u2019ve been through to understand that, even though in the beginning of an experience you have some expectations, you also have to adapt to your colleagues, the work pace of everyone and the resources you have and try to achieve a similar goal while being coherent with everything. Personal Design Space update \u00b6 The way my Design Space has changed thanks to this experience isn\u2019t the most obvious one. After reflecting on the Design Intervention concept and gone through the exercise, I\u2019ve changed 2 things of my Design Space. Firstly, I\u2019ve added a sub-part that connects 2 weak signals: social media and non-heteropatriarcal innovation. In this sub-part I want to fit in my interest in the perception we have as a society of \u201cbeauty\u201d and how it affects us, specially women and specially teenagers and middle-aged women. I\u2019ve been interested to see how the new generations are evolving with the same concept of \u201cbeauty\u201d and this differences confronts the generations/age groups when living in society. A couple of decades ago, the concept of \u201cbeauty\u201d was a much closed box where, if you didn\u2019t fit into, you were out of. Nowadays, it seems to be a bit more open and accepting but still very much a box. It\u2019s also interesting to see how, even though we are more \u201copen\u201d to different forms of beauty, at the same time there are much more \u201cbeauty treatments\u201d, operations and interventions to alter our faces and bodies\u2026 Second of all, I\u2019ve gathered a list of Design Interventions I could personally do to explore other parts of my Design Space I don\u2019t know much about or O haven\u2019t specifically experienced in my own skin. This session and the \u201cLiving with your own ideas\u201d seminar have helped me see the importance of \u201cforcing\u201d myself to live certain experiences to further my knowledge and evolve into my interests.

Laura Benitez What? Personal narratives, collective storytelling Contents \u00b6 The contents of Laura\u2019s class were focused on the philosophical concept of narrative and story-telling. The first hour was a more theoretical hour in which Laura explained very well several concepts of various authors around the theme of Design Studio that day. During that hour we talked about power, bodies, interactions and relationships, matter, worl(d)ing, and, finally, figures. With the concept of figure, Laura proposed the first deliverable. It was an individual exercise that you can find in the \u201cDeliverables\u201d section. After the break, Laura proposed a second exercise. In this case, it was a group exercise. We all stood around the class and Laura started by tying a fennel stitch of red thread in her hand. The exercise consisted in passing the thread among all of us while controlling the network that was being formed with a reflection on how we are living the master and the learning of the last weeks. The final result was a network of red thread that united us all, symbolizing the shared experience and the collective storytelling about our journey in the master. Reflection \u00b6 This was my first philosophy class with Laura. The truth is that it seemed to me a very different class from the ones we have done so far. The contents that Laura explained to us are very far from what I have studied and it is a little difficult for me to follow the line sometimes. I think that, for all of us, it is even more difficult because it is not in our usual language. Anyway I am very interested to see how design and philosophy can really intertwine. I was especially interested in Spinoza\u2019s concept of potestas/potentia, at first I didn\u2019t understand it but with the examples and the explanation I seem to get the concept.

The first hour was a more theoretical hour in which Laura explained very well several concepts of various authors around the theme of Design Studio that day. During that hour we talked about power, bodies, interactions and relationships, matter, worl(d)ing, and, finally, figures. With the concept of figure, Laura proposed the first deliverable. It was an individual exercise that you can find in the \u201cDeliverables\u201d section. After the break, Laura proposed a second exercise. In this case, it was a group exercise. We all stood around the class and Laura started by tying a fennel stitch of red thread in her hand. The exercise consisted in passing the thread among all of us while controlling the network that was being formed with a reflection on how we are living the master and the learning of the last weeks. The final result was a network of red thread that united us all, symbolizing the shared experience and the collective storytelling about our journey in the master.","title":"Contents"},{"location":"term1/Session%203/#reflection","text":"This was my first philosophy class with Laura. The truth is that it seemed to me a very different class from the ones we have done so far. The contents that Laura explained to us are very far from what I have studied and it is a little difficult for me to follow the line sometimes. I think that, for all of us, it is even more difficult because it is not in our usual language. Anyway I am very interested to see how design and philosophy can really intertwine. I was especially interested in Spinoza\u2019s concept of potestas/potentia, at first I didn\u2019t understand it but with the examples and the explanation I seem to get the concept.

Roger Guilemany and Jana Tothill What? A collective design action with humans and/or non-humans Contents \u00b6 The contents we were given in the fourth design studio session revolved around \u201creflection as a design tool\u201d. They way I understood it the most was with the following tool: After we complete an intervention or a design or a project, it is crucial to go through the process of reflection. To reflect means to learn, to look back and to ask questions to yourself in order to go forward. In our course we have many ways of reflecting and they are structred in 3 levels: deliverables \u2192 reflective diary feedback/reviews \u2192 reflective critique design studio \u2192 reflective dialogue With that in mind, we had to go back to the collective design space and add/move/take out the papers and threads according to our reflection after the first intervention. Once this was done we had to form new groups to create the second collective intervention. Deliverable/Intervention \u00b6 My group was made by Carmen, Sophie and myself. We started talking about our interests and ended up writting a Collective Design Space to have a clearer vision of our common interests. Our intervention involved all the members of our class and some of our friends outside the master. The aim of the exercise was to make people think about their digital identity, how are we perceived on the internet? 1- We asked our classmates for permission to show their Instagram profiles to our friends. 2- We created a survey with very specific and limited response questions in order to have the same model with everyone. 3- We showed the 18 profiles to our friends, each profile was analyzed only once. They had to answer the survey while analyzing the profile. 4- We collected all the data about the profiles and put them in anonymous card format, in order to set up the game. 5- We asked people in the class to try to identify themselves with one of the profiles we had hung on the wall. When they identified themselves they had to paste their picture on the card. 6- We revealed the final solution of the people to whom the profiles corresponded, and recorded their reactions. 7- We conducted interviews to find out if they identified with the description our friends had made of them. Reflection \u00b6 Biases in Answers: It\u2019s important to know that the people giving opinions might have their own personal preferences or views. We should tell them about this before the activity so that everyone understands that the results might be a bit one-sided. Missing Political Question: We forgot to ask about people\u2019s political views, and that could have been interesting. Even though it\u2019s a tricky topic, it can tell us a lot about how people see each other online. Limited Questions and Similar Answers: The questions we asked had only a few possible answers, making everyone\u2019s profiles seem kind of the same. It would be better to have more varied questions that let people share more about themselves. Class Reactions: The coolest part was seeing how everyone reacted when we showed them what others thought about them. This made everyone think about how they present themselves online and what others might think. In the future, we can make the questions more open-ended and talk about possible biases before starting. We could also try asking about political views, even if it\u2019s a bit tricky. This exercise was great for making us think about how we come across online and how others see us. What now? \u00b6 \u2794 what would you like to learn more about, related to this project or issue? The mental health implications there can be when we talk about digital identity. Many people aren\u2019t aware they are creating a digital identity when using social media, but it\u2019s intrinsic in the use of these platforms. Whether we want it or not, they way we are perceived by others can affect our mental health and I would like to learn more about the implications it can have to our well-being. \u2794 what follow-up is needed to address any challenges or difficulties? Maybe a previous conversation with the people involved on the topic, so we can also analyze the mental process happening when they discover how they are being perceived by others. \u2794 if you could do the project again, what would you do differently? After doing the exercise, I would change some questions of the survey and also the way we approached people\u2019s reactions to their digital profile. I think many people took it as a game and many reflections were lost by approaching it like a fun thing and now like an exercise of self-reflection. \u2794 how will your efforts on this project contribute to your career? I think I\u2019m shaping a path on my career that doesn\u2019t have a clear end, but that is visibly touching some social and contemporary issues like mental health and life in the digital era. \u2794 how can society better address the problem from the project? It\u2019s a complex issue to address because it\u2019s a big one, I think the first step is to reflect on it and make people aware of it. From here, we could redesign the way we use social media or how social media is designed in order to reduce the negative impact in can have in our mental health and self-esteem. \u2794 where do you go from here?

The operation of the seminar basically consisted of unpacking and disassembling old and unused machines (TVs, printers, speakers, microwaves\u2026) in order to understand how they work on the inside. Later on, once we have the components identified and prove that they work, figure out a new way to reassemble them, designing a new machine. How? \u00b6 Forensics of the obsolescence \u00b6 The first part of the seminar (first 4 days) was about the forensics of obsolescence. This concept wants to talk about how technology isn\u2019t a neutral element; it depends on many factors such as economic powers, influences, certain interests\u2026 At the end of the day, technology is a cultural artifact; it represents the society it grows into, and within the whole process of developing technology, many cultural decisions have to be made. The deliverable of the first part of the seminar was a Forensic Report on a chosen machine. I was lucky enough to work with Marius, Anna, Jorge, Flora, and Anthuanet to deliver the document of the Forensic Report. To create the document, we went through a process of disassembling an old LCD screen from beginning to end. We started by disassembling the main parts to understand it, then assembling them again to see which components were working and which weren\u2019t. We found out the connection between the motherboard and the screen wasn\u2019t working, so the machine was powered and turned on but couldn\u2019t play any content. We then continued disassembling the LCD screen itself and did some research on the different layers of filters it has. We were interested in powering on the backlight of the screen, but the connection cables were too old, and we accidentally broke them. We ended up with 2 functional strips of 80 LED lights each; we could power on and off the strips by little 10 LED strings. Rethink and reconnect \u00b6 The second part of the seminar \u201cThe Machine Paradox\u201d started at the end of the first week, once we had analyzed every component in our broken machine and categorized which ones worked and how they worked, it became the time to brainstorm new machines from what we had around. We had to build new machines basing our design on 4 principles: Honesty: the same design has to explain itself, do not hide anything. Simplicity: reducing processes and materials to the essential number. Uselessness: without a real and useful functionality for anyone. Process: acknowledge the process behind the design and give it value. With my group, once we got all the information, we did a brainstorm together to put on a piece of paper all of the ideas all of us had been gathering the previous days. We saw that there were a lot of ideas coming from all 6 of us, maybe too many. So, we decided to group the ideas into 3 main topics and split into pairs to explore these topics and come up with a proposition. The 3 final ideas we got out of this brainstorm were: an endless cycle machine to activate a ventilator, a FOMO machine to reflect on the pain screens induce on us, and a random Tik Tok scroll machine to represent the frustration of the lack of control. After evaluating the ideas and consulting with the teachers, we chose the FOMO machine. The FOMO machine, or The Fuck Duck Machine, is a device that wants to reflect on \"how much pain are we willing to take to feed our FOMO?\". We understand the concept FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) as the anxiety created by an event happening elsewhere and you didn't attend. The Fuck Duck Machine feeds this FOMO feeling by revealing part of the content on the screen every time you press a button that also induces pain. Once we had the idea, we had to properly design it and plan the whole building process. We agreed on the design and saw that the machine had ultimately 3 parts: the main box, the motor and Arduino for it, and finally the pain button. Since we all knew what materials and methods we were going to use for the parts, we split them considering the personal interests and skills of everyone. In my case, I started building the pain button with Annna. The proper building of the machine was the longest part and the most intense one. A lot of us were facing machines and materials we had never touched before, and it was a bit challenging. Personally, I really liked being able to research and investigate how to make a button that induces pain to the user. At the end of the day, we couldn\u2019t find anything on the market similar because it goes against regulations, so we had to build it ourselves. The first plan was to 3D print a button to integrate the internal part of a lighter (which would induce a small electroshock every time you clicked it). The process of 3D printing was difficult and long, and we soon realized that we had to also integrate the button that would give the signal to the Arduino board, so we had double complexity. We changed plans and built a transparent block of layers of laser-cut acrylic, so we could control the size of the holes on every layer and integrate both buttons (that were completely different). Finally, the challenge was to create a \u201ccover\u201d that would activate both buttons at the same time and allow the electricity to pass to the finger pressing it. We considered plastic, but we were faced with the same problem as before; it was too complex and time-consuming (we were running out of time at this point). We finally built a 3-layer wooden cover to go on top of the buttons with a hole for the cable to electroshock. The last problem we had was that the electricity didn\u2019t go through the cable if the wooden cover was on, and, in fact, it only worked if a finger or a metallic piece pressed it. We solved the problem by putting copper tape around it. Once we all finished the building process, we had the final result of our Fuck Duck Machine. It was the moment to shoot a <1 minute video self-explanatory on how the machine worked and what it did. We received help to draw our storyboard, and once this was done, the filming process was pretty quick. We got to do some acting and have some fun after finishing the machine. Reflections \u00b6 19/10/2023 17:55 \u00b6 After completing the Forensics of the obsolescence part The thing that has shocked me the most these 3 days has been the disassembling part. Tearing apart the TV monitor and realizing that behind every screen we see, there\u2019s actually real materials and not just an \u201cether\u201d that \u201ctransports data\u201d into the \u201ccloud\u201d. Learning the physical elements behind a screen, that for me is something unreal, untouchable, doesn\u2019t belong to the world of objects, made me open my view to other products i use in my everyday life and think how might they be made, what\u2019s inside of them\u2026 It has reminded me of a video made by a friend of mine, very worth seeing: The impact of the internet from helena boet on Vimeo . It was very interesting, also, starting this project (that for me is a bit out of my league) with people I don\u2019t know, at all. It has been working out very well, I\u2019m glad to see we all have a proactive attitude towards the class and I\u2019m enjoying getting to know them through it. 28/10/2023 10:59 \u00b6 After presenting the final project the day before Yesterday, we presented our unuseful machine, The Fuck Duck Machine. Today, after a restful night and some time to reflect, I\u2019ve gathered a few insights from the past few weeks. Firstly, collaborating with a group of unfamiliar faces flows more smoothly when we\u2019re engaged in practical, hands-on activities. It was my first time working with my team (and meeting them at all), and we quickly understood how we all worked and what we were able to do at any given point. I think this fast learning from each other was caused by the intensity of the project but also because it was a practical project. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t have learned that much if we had spent the 2 weeks all sitting at a table talking and hypothetically designing. As for how my relationship with technology is evolving, I still empathize with what I wrote in the last reflection; the power of comprehending the inner workings of things. Last week, I was talking about how much it shocked me to see the components behind an LCD screen. This week I\u2019ve seen this importance also in understanding the machines and techniques we use to build. For example, when Santi very kindly explained to me how the laser cut machine worked and all of the steps you have to take before sending the file to cut, I understood and learned what he was explaining. Later on, when I had to manage the machine by myself, I didn\u2019t remember the steps by memory but because I understood them, and it made sense to me. This logic can apply to every machine and material I\u2019ve used, such as the 3D printer, Arduino, vinyl cutter, woodworking, electroshock, and more. Another important lesson I\u2019ve learned is that in the face of failure, it\u2019s wiser to attempt to repair what has gone wrong before scrapping the whole project. However, there\u2019s a fine line when it comes to investing your energy in a fix. It\u2019s crucial to know when it\u2019s best to move on. I\u2019m still learning when to let go or not of my initial ideas. I\u2019m a planner and I like following straight paths, but in prototyping and design in general, there isn\u2019t such a thing. Lastly, I\u2019m aware I wouldn\u2019t have accomplished this project or the learning I take with me without the help of our teachers and the collaboration of my colleagues. At the end of the day, no one knows everything, and everyone knows a bit of everything. If I had to do this by myself, I would\u2019ve designed a much less original machine in a much longer period of time.","title":"the machine paradox"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#the-machine-paradox","text":"Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga, Guillem Camprodon, Oscar Gonzalez, Josep Marti Elias, Petra Garajov\u00e1, Adai Surinach & Mikel Llobera 17-27 October 2023","title":"The machine paradox"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#what","text":"The different goals of the Machine Paradox seminar were to talk about how technology affects society, explore new and unusual technologies that are out there but not widely known, make things quickly and effectively using various tools and methods, embrace a mindset of creativity and collaboration, and share what we know with others.

We understand the concept FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) as the anxiety created by an event happening elsewhere and you didn't attend. The Fuck Duck Machine feeds this FOMO feeling by revealing part of the content on the screen every time you press a button that also induces pain. Once we had the idea, we had to properly design it and plan the whole building process. We agreed on the design and saw that the machine had ultimately 3 parts: the main box, the motor and Arduino for it, and finally the pain button. Since we all knew what materials and methods we were going to use for the parts, we split them considering the personal interests and skills of everyone. In my case, I started building the pain button with Annna. The proper building of the machine was the longest part and the most intense one. A lot of us were facing machines and materials we had never touched before, and it was a bit challenging. Personally, I really liked being able to research and investigate how to make a button that induces pain to the user. At the end of the day, we couldn\u2019t find anything on the market similar because it goes against regulations, so we had to build it ourselves. The first plan was to 3D print a button to integrate the internal part of a lighter (which would induce a small electroshock every time you clicked it). The process of 3D printing was difficult and long, and we soon realized that we had to also integrate the button that would give the signal to the Arduino board, so we had double complexity. We changed plans and built a transparent block of layers of laser-cut acrylic, so we could control the size of the holes on every layer and integrate both buttons (that were completely different). Finally, the challenge was to create a \u201ccover\u201d that would activate both buttons at the same time and allow the electricity to pass to the finger pressing it. We considered plastic, but we were faced with the same problem as before; it was too complex and time-consuming (we were running out of time at this point). We finally built a 3-layer wooden cover to go on top of the buttons with a hole for the cable to electroshock. The last problem we had was that the electricity didn\u2019t go through the cable if the wooden cover was on, and, in fact, it only worked if a finger or a metallic piece pressed it. We solved the problem by putting copper tape around it. Once we all finished the building process, we had the final result of our Fuck Duck Machine. It was the moment to shoot a <1 minute video self-explanatory on how the machine worked and what it did. We received help to draw our storyboard, and once this was done, the filming process was pretty quick. We got to do some acting and have some fun after finishing the machine.","title":"Rethink and reconnect"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#reflections","text":"","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#19102023-1755","text":"After completing the Forensics of the obsolescence part The thing that has shocked me the most these 3 days has been the disassembling part. Tearing apart the TV monitor and realizing that behind every screen we see, there\u2019s actually real materials and not just an \u201cether\u201d that \u201ctransports data\u201d into the \u201ccloud\u201d. Learning the physical elements behind a screen, that for me is something unreal, untouchable, doesn\u2019t belong to the world of objects, made me open my view to other products i use in my everyday life and think how might they be made, what\u2019s inside of them\u2026 It has reminded me of a video made by a friend of mine, very worth seeing: The impact of the internet from helena boet on Vimeo . It was very interesting, also, starting this project (that for me is a bit out of my league) with people I don\u2019t know, at all. It has been working out very well, I\u2019m glad to see we all have a proactive attitude towards the class and I\u2019m enjoying getting to know them through it.","title":"19/10/2023 17:55"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#28102023-1059","text":"After presenting the final project the day before Yesterday, we presented our unuseful machine, The Fuck Duck Machine. Today, after a restful night and some time to reflect, I\u2019ve gathered a few insights from the past few weeks. Firstly, collaborating with a group of unfamiliar faces flows more smoothly when we\u2019re engaged in practical, hands-on activities. It was my first time working with my team (and meeting them at all), and we quickly understood how we all worked and what we were able to do at any given point. I think this fast learning from each other was caused by the intensity of the project but also because it was a practical project. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t have learned that much if we had spent the 2 weeks all sitting at a table talking and hypothetically designing. As for how my relationship with technology is evolving, I still empathize with what I wrote in the last reflection; the power of comprehending the inner workings of things. Last week, I was talking about how much it shocked me to see the components behind an LCD screen. This week I\u2019ve seen this importance also in understanding the machines and techniques we use to build. For example, when Santi very kindly explained to me how the laser cut machine worked and all of the steps you have to take before sending the file to cut, I understood and learned what he was explaining. Later on, when I had to manage the machine by myself, I didn\u2019t remember the steps by memory but because I understood them, and it made sense to me. This logic can apply to every machine and material I\u2019ve used, such as the 3D printer, Arduino, vinyl cutter, woodworking, electroshock, and more. Another important lesson I\u2019ve learned is that in the face of failure, it\u2019s wiser to attempt to repair what has gone wrong before scrapping the whole project. However, there\u2019s a fine line when it comes to investing your energy in a fix. It\u2019s crucial to know when it\u2019s best to move on. I\u2019m still learning when to let go or not of my initial ideas. I\u2019m a planner and I like following straight paths, but in prototyping and design in general, there isn\u2019t such a thing. Lastly, I\u2019m aware I wouldn\u2019t have accomplished this project or the learning I take with me without the help of our teachers and the collaboration of my colleagues. At the end of the day, no one knows everything, and everyone knows a bit of everything. If I had to do this by myself, I would\u2019ve designed a much less original machine in a much longer period of time.","title":"28/10/2023 10:59"},{"location":"term2/ClimateEmergency/","text":"Design in a State of Climate Emergency \u00b6 Andr\u00e9s Colmenares 2-12 Gener 2024 Contents \u00b6 Deliverable \u00b6 Final Reflection \u00b6","title":"state of climate emergency"},{"location":"term2/ClimateEmergency/#design-in-a-state-of-climate-emergency","text":"Andr\u00e9s Colmenares 2-12 Gener 2024","title":"Design in a State of Climate Emergency"},{"location":"term2/ClimateEmergency/#contents","text":"","title":"Contents"},{"location":"term2/ClimateEmergency/#deliverable","text":"","title":"Deliverable"},{"location":"term2/ClimateEmergency/#final-reflection","text":"","title":"Final Reflection"}]}

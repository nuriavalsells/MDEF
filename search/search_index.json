I\u2019m a 24-year-old from Barcelona who graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Industrial Design and Product Development Engineering from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya. After graduation, I began working at Azimut 360, a non-profit cooperative dedicated to the engineering and installation of photovoltaic systems, both nationally and internationally. However, I soon realized that my interests extended far beyond designing everyday objects and products in a more elegant, aesthetic way. I wanted to use my skills to make a positive impact on society. That\u2019s why I pursued a Master\u2019s degree in Social Design. Through my studies, I have expanded my knowledge and vision of industrial design as a tool for transforming everything that is already established. From industrial and manufacturing processes to the most everyday objects that perpetuate attitudes in society that need to change in order to move forward. In addition to my studies, I have also undertaken personal projects that are closely aligned with the values of social transformation and change. For example, I volunteered as a leisure monitor for 4 years for the association Minyons Escoltes i Guies, where I had the opportunity to educate children and develop my leadership skills. Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction, and I look forward to sharing my portfolio with you.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#get-to-know-me","text":"Hello, my name is Nuria Valsells Vilalta, and I\u2019m excited to introduce you to my MDEF documenation page.

During this research, I discovered unexpected connections between various specific subjects, which have the potential to serve as activators to new original design approaches and concepts. The exercise provided me with the opportunity to immerse myself in previously unknown territory, as a result, I was able to pinpoint the topics that resonated most deeply with me. The core themes that consistently surfaced in my mind the most were Rural Futures and Non-heteropatriarchal Innovation.

The different goals of the Machine Paradox seminar were to talk about how technology affects society, explore new and unusual technologies that are out there but not widely known, make things quickly and effectively using various tools and methods, embrace a mindset of creativity and collaboration, and share what we know with others. The operation of the seminar basically consisted of unpacking and disassembling old and unused machines (TVs, printers, speakers, microwaves\u2026) in order to understand how they work on the inside. Later on, once we have the components identified and prove that they work, figure out a new way to reassemble them, designing a new machine. How? Forensics of the obsolescence The first part of the seminar (first 4 days) was about the forensics of obsolescence. This concept wants to talk about how technology isn\u2019t a neutral element, it depends on many factors such as economic powers, influences, certain interests\u2026 At the end of the day, technology is a cultural artifact, it represents the society it grows into and within the whole process of developing technology, many cultural decisions have to be made. The deliverable of the first part of the seminar was a Forensic Report on a chosen machine. I was lucky enough to work with Marius, Anna, Jorge, Flora and Anthuanet to deliver the document of the Forensic Report . \u201cDesign Part\u201d blablablabla Reflections 19/10/2023 17:55 - After completing the Forensics of the obsolescence part The thing that has shocked me the most these 3 days has been the disassembling part. Tearing apart the TV monitor and realizing that behind every screen we see, there\u2019s actually real materials and not just an \u201cether\u201d that \u201ctransports data\u201d into the \u201ccloud\u201d. Learning the physical elements behind a screen, that for me is something unreal, untouchable, doesn\u2019t belong to the world of objects, made me open my view to other products i use in my everyday life and think how might they be made, what\u2019s inside of them\u2026 It has reminded me of a video made by a friend of mine, very worth seeing: https://vimeo.com/875316804 It was very interesting, also, starting this project (that for me is a bit out of my league) with people I don\u2019t know, at all. It has been working out very well, I\u2019m glad to see we all have a proactive attitude towards the class and I\u2019m enjoying getting to know them through it.","title":"The Machine Paradox"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#the-machine-paradox","text":"What?

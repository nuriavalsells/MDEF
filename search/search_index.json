I\u2019m a 24-year-old from Barcelona who graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Industrial Design and Product Development Engineering from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya. After graduation, I began working at Azimut 360, a non-profit cooperative dedicated to the engineering and installation of photovoltaic systems, both nationally and internationally. However, I soon realized that my interests extended far beyond designing everyday objects and products in a more elegant, aesthetic way. I wanted to use my skills to make a positive impact on society. That\u2019s why I pursued a Master\u2019s degree in Social Design. Through my studies, I have expanded my knowledge and vision of industrial design as a tool for transforming everything that is already established. From industrial and manufacturing processes to the most everyday objects that perpetuate attitudes in society that need to change in order to move forward. I spent 1 year taking a Master in Social Design at NABA (Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti) in Milan, Italy. It was a very interesting year, I learned a lot from my teachers and collegues and I got to participate in meaningful projects that motivated me a lot. When I started, this last September, the second course of the Master, I realized that the second year wasn\u2019t gonna fufill my expectations and the experience wasn\u2019t motivating enough for me. The 15 th of October I made the decision to move back to Barcelona and start the Master in Design for Emergent Futures. So far, I\u2019m very happy with my decision and I think it will bring me a lot of positive things, while living again in my beloved Barcelona <3.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#get-to-know-me","text":"Hello, my name is N\u00faria Valsells Vilalta, and I\u2019m excited to introduce you to my MDEF documenation page.

These aspects added a layer of relevance and intrigue to the subject matter for me. However, the broad nature of the class left me wanting more depth in a specific area. It felt like a surface exploration, and I yearn to delve deeper into a particular aspect. Despite the overall general nature of the seminar not resonating with me entirely, I did find pockets of interest that I\u2019m keen to explore further on a more focused level.

Mosquitoes, especially certain species, can transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus and chikungunya. These diseases are more severe in poor areas and can lead to many illnesses and, unfortunately, even death. Mosquitoes are everywhere, and factors such as urban expansion and climate change are making the problem worse. Possible solutions: Reduce the spread of disease Disease resistant plants Predatory insects that kill disease carriers Organisms with similar functions in nature: Naturally Resistant Plants: Plants that naturally exhibit resistance to insect-borne diseases. Predatory insects in ecosystems: understanding the mechanisms of population control of natural enemies of disease-carrying insects. Property Recipient: Wild mosquito populations: Wild mosquito populations are genetically modified to reduce their ability to transmit disease. Crop varieties: Implement disease resistance measures on key crop varieties to protect agricultural yields. Predatory insects in urban environments: Enhancing natural enemies of disease-carrying insects to control their populations in urban areas. Other ecological balance considerations: We need to ensure that the introduction of modified organisms does not disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem. References \u00b6 I wanted to include some GMO projects I\u2019ve found while doing the deliverable: Hy-Fi\u201d by The Living: The architectural design studio The Living, which is part of Autodesk, created a temporary installation known as \u201cHy-Fi\u201d at MoMA PS1 in New York. The structure was made of biodegradable bricks composed of corn stalks and living mycelium (a type of fungus). The living mycelium bricks were used to construct a tower that responded to environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, by changing its properties over time. BioUrban\u201d by Urban Greening: While not furniture, the BioUrban project by Urban Greening is an example of using microorganisms to improve urban environments. BioUrban is a vertical garden system that uses microalgae to capture carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. It can be applied to urban structures like buildings and highways to help purify the air in cities. \u201cMoss Carpet\u201d by Nguyen La Chanh: While not furniture in the traditional sense, the \u201cMoss Carpet\u201d is an example of living design. Vietnamese designer Nguyen La Chanh created a bath mat made of moss that thrives on the humidity of a bathroom. The moss mat is a functional and decorative piece that incorporates living organisms into the design. \u201cBiological Wall\u201d by EcoLogic Studio: The architectural design firm EcoLogic Studio has developed the \u201cUrban Greening\u201d project, which includes the \u201cBioUrban\u201d system mentioned earlier. They\u2019ve also designed biological walls, known as \u201cH.O.R.T.U.S. XL Astaxanthin.g.\u201d These living installations combine microalgae and real-time data monitoring to create an ever-changing and self-regulating environment.

The prospect of incorporating biology into my future projects seemed incidental, and I figured I could manage by reaching out to experts if needed. However, despite my low interest in the subject matter, I realized the significance of staying updated on scientific developments. This realization was sparked by Nuria\u2019s class, where the coverage of current scientific news caught my attention and became an aspect I found extremely intriguing. Moreover, I developed a newfound appreciation for the concept of using nature as a toolbox, especially in the realm of design. The idea of drawing inspiration and solutions from the natural world resonated with me. Even though the specific topic of the seminar may not have deeply captivated me, the broader perspective of staying informed about scientific advancements and embracing nature as a source of innovation left a lasting impression. It made me consider the broader implications and applications of these ideas beyond the immediate context of the seminar, potentially influencing my approach to future projects.","title":"biology zero"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#biology-zero","text":"Nuria Conde 7-9 November 2023","title":"Biology zero"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#contents","text":"The week we took the Biology Zero class with Nuria we were fortunate to make an experiment thet consisted in cultivating microbes. 1.Build our own medium to host the microbes 2.Sterilize the container with the medium in a pressure cooker and vert the medium into a, also sterile, petri dish. 3.Go \u201chunting\u201d for microbes with the petri dishes 4.After 1 day in the incubator at 25\u00baC, some colonies are formed and we can observe them through the microscope","title":"Contents"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#deliverable","text":"","title":"Deliverable"},{"location":"term1/Biology%20Zero/#design-idea","text":"Issue: Transmission of insect-borne diseases The global problem of mosquito-borne diseases is a major health concern affecting many people around the world.

The prospect of incorporating biology into my future projects seemed incidental, and I figured I could manage by reaching out to experts if needed. However, despite my low interest in the subject matter, I realized the significance of staying updated on scientific developments. This realization was sparked by Nuria\u2019s class, where the coverage of current scientific news caught my attention and became an aspect I found extremely intriguing. Moreover, I developed a newfound appreciation for the concept of using nature as a toolbox, especially in the realm of design. The idea of drawing inspiration and solutions from the natural world resonated with me. Even though the specific topic of the seminar may not have deeply captivated me, the broader perspective of staying informed about scientific advancements and embracing nature as a source of innovation left a lasting impression. It made me consider the broader implications and applications of these ideas beyond the immediate context of the seminar, potentially influencing my approach to future projects.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term1/Design%20Studio/","text":"The Design Studio class is a transversal semniar that will go on during the whole year.

This method is a new way for designers and creators to experiment their own design research on themselves (their body, their environment, theirs interests, theirs tools\u2026) The method says that we can use our own bodies to explore, to communicate, to research. This allows us to take the design process to another level, to analyze our whole body. When involving the body into the design process you relate the product you design with the experience your body lives. FPP allows us to be situated as actors in environments and generate change. Acknowledging situated and partial knowledge, creating interactive, transversal and open-ended RtD. Involving yourself into the design process also brings all kinds of knowledge. It\u2019s the responsibility of the designer to entangle it into the process (culture, history, values, identity, ways of working\u2026). At the same time, you also bring all of your skills. Involving yourself is also a political act because you decide what to do and what not to do. The mix makes the design unique for yourself. FPP allows different temporalities to coexist in the same process. You create past, present and futures with your experience, imagination and memory. You bring your roots, your whole brain. At the end of the day, the goal of the First Person Perspective is to support affirmative creativity; avoid thinking what is right or wrong, instead analyze how the project/prototype impacts myself while testing it in my everyday life. Deliverables \u00b6 Create a companion \u00b6 The first deliverable of the seminar consists of a rapid lo-fi prototyping of a personal companion that wants to adress a topic of your live. In my case, i decided to create a \u201cDo You Want a Hug Machine\u201d to represent my relationship with the concept of love. Although my heart is internally a mess and doesn\u2019t know what it wants, a simple gesture as a hug will satisfy it momentarily. First Person Perspective Design Intervention \u00b6 How does it feel to be out of context in Barcelona? Is Barcelona welcoming to non-local people? I decided to buy 24h Bus Turistic pass in Barcelona and spend a day moving around only with this transport. It has 2 lines of bus, I have a stop next to my house but Iaac is not very well communicated. By blending into the touristic bus i want to observe my own city with other eyes and see how i react when i place myself into an unknown context in my own city. Click here to see the video The experience started from Iaac, Thursday November 2 nd , when I embarked on the journey to get to the tourist bus to get back home. It took me 2 hours to get home, I had to stop to change lines and I forced myself to listen to the audio guide the whole way. At first, it felt a bit challenging to adapt to the new mode of transportation since I\u2019m so accustomed to the public one but once i got the the station i just had to buy my tickets, that\u2019s when I felt shy to speak catalan in such an \u201cinternational\u201d environment, it also felt like the workers who attended me were also surprised. As the touristic bus journey continued through the streets of Barcelona, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the people around us were often indifferent, ignoring our presence. This provoked a weird feeling in me, even more when it was mixed with the perspective from above, almost like watching a movie, providing a strange viewpoint for urban sightseeing. Even though the route I was taking was no different than the one I take everyday, the slower pace of the touristic bus allowed me to discover new restaurants and shops that I had previously overlooked. While I did appreciate this aspect, I found the overall experience a bit boring. Reflection \u00b6 Things that could have been done better or differently: Do an action that better reflects the tourist experience in Barcelona: the Tourist Bus maybe isn\u2019t the most effective way to see Barcelona from a tourist perspective, I\u2019ll keep in mind to explore other ways to pursue this goal. Do it more times: it would be interesting to see how the experience changes when it\u2019s repeated more than once. Interact more with people: during the action i was completely a sponge, i didn\u2019t intend to interact with anyone or anything actively, i wonder how this would change the experience. Reflections: Separate myself from the action: I initially wanted to change my view of Barcelona and see the city from completely different eyes. While I was on the bus I found myself trying to force another gaze of the city and failing at it, this caused a bit of frustration. What I realized after that, is that I cannot separate who I am in my own actions, so I have to be conscious about it and accept this mixture between the event and my person. I will always be biased, as the more conscious I am about, the more coherent I will be with my actions and results. Test before imposing: after the action took place, I realized that if I\u2019d had to design a similar action for someone else, maybe I would\u2019ve made it more complex and effective (collect data in a more precise way, join more than one action in a period of time, involve 3 rd parties\u2026) but at the same time, probably, less adequate for the \u201cuser\u201d or the person doing it. It made me go slower and easier on the process, be more patient on what is worth discarding and what is worth my attention. I tend to be fast, impatient, effective, resolutive\u2026 This method is making me slow down and appreciate what I would probably miss if I designed as I\u2019ve always designed. What now?: When I was doing a brainstorm to decide what action I would take, I came up with a pretty long list of possibilities that relate somehow to my design space. Even though for logistic reasons I had to choose one, I still have the list and I plan on doing some of the interventions I thought of.","title":"living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"Oscar Tomico, Kristina Andersen & Angella Mackay 31-2 November 2023","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#content","text":"The \u201cLiving With Your Own Ideas\u201d seminar is focused on the First Person Perspective Design Research.

Roles of Prototyping in 1PP Research through design Reflection \u00b6 It is interesting to think about the new role of designers as a change of positioning within the relationship it has with the community it wants to serve, to think about the First Person Perspective in design. Until now I had always learned that designers, architects, engineers\u2026 where this omnipotent figure that could solve a problem by producing products or services for the user. These concepts hold many assumptions that don\u2019t make any sense anymore; as designers we know what users need, everyone interacts with a new product or service the same way, the concept of a \u201cgood design\u201d as an fully useful product for everyone everywhere and many more worth mentioning. Doing the thought process of placing the role of the designer inside the community, as a stakeholder or element in a system that works, has initially left me with the feeling that the First Person Perspective limits us as designers by saying we can only impact the systems we are part of. While this is the first reaction I had, I\u2019ve realized that by forming part of the system we can have much more efficient well-oriented solutions to our designs. You no longer are imposing ideas; you are just one more piece of the puzzle, needed to be completed but useless on its own.

Roger Guilemany and Jana Tothill What? Areas of Intervention in a Multiscalar Design Space Contents \u00b6 We were introduced with the concept of Design Intervention. What can a design intervention be? Can and should be developed with others in context - An opportunity to co-create and iterate prototypes with others An experience that transforms yourself and others - open your mind to new scopes An action to start building trust - the first step to human relationships is trust in order to be able to co-create Am activity to bring difficult topics to the table - safe space An experience to learn and from others An experience to learn through a situated action - understanding the context that will allow us to propose something. To understand the direction that one\u2019s trying to take in the project. Relationship between Design Intervention and Design Space The Design Intervention will allow us to show the context that the Design Space is mapping so that we can create iterations of the Design Space diagram and investigate new elements in it. A Design Intervention doesn\u2019t have to be perfect or unique, is a key part of a process that consists in several actions that will lead us to build the final design space (if it ever exists). A Design Intervention can be used to understand issues we don\u2019t control, to clear our minds about them, to research unknown paths or to validate already existing ones. The four key roles a Design Intervention can have within a Design Space are: \u2794 Organizational: to visualize the ideas we have in a Design Space \u2794 Narrative: to give a voice to these ideas, so we can understand their process and development \u2794 Performative or Participative: to involve stakeholders or make it understand to the public \u2794 Inspirational: to research new developments and continue the journey Exercise A. Start sharing the elements we have printed in a big board and relate them to the ones everyone brought. B. In groups, create a Collective Design Space According to the Collective Design Space Mural we assembeled a group with similar interests. My group was formed by Annna, Everardo, Francisca and Drishya. Together we talked about our areas of interest and came up with a group Collective Design Space. C. Think about a Design Intervention to make within the shared interests and Design Space. Finally, after exploring many options we decided to conduct the following Design Intervention: We\u2019ve designed a collective Design Intervention to explore how alterations of your face can change your perception of yourself; either hide a part of you or enhance it. We want to give the possibility of changing your face to a specific group of people, and allow them to reflect on reconfiguration of the body. This change they can apply to their faces, might be on purpose to hide a part they don\u2019t like or either enhance another one they love. For the intervention, we have organized an event or party at Everardo\u2019s house with our friends. We believe that the relaxed atmosphere of this type of space gives the participant more room to get carried away. Our intervention wants to explore the following questions: - Did you choose to alter your face to hide or change a part of yourself you don\u2019t like? Or to enhace your existing identity? - After changing your face, do you feel more like yourself or less like yourself? Reflection \u00b6 Reflection on the Collective Design Space \u00b6 Doing the Collective Design Space was a bit overwhelming for me at first. From having to place my cards to, then, looking at the whole wall once it was finished. The concept of not having a right/wrong reasons to place your concepts disturbed me a little bit, but I soon went along with it. Once I looked at the wall I also felt a bit overwhelmed, so I quickly focused on a specific area of it, the one that interested me the most. Even though I choose an area of the wall, I was interested in all the groups that were formed, every topic chosen could\u2019ve fit in my own interests. Despite that, I decided to go with a group that was doing something different from what I\u2019m used to, so that I could explore more other options. Reflection on the group work \u00b6 The group work was very intense from the beginning, we choose an area of the Collective Design Space that was very plural, it had a lot of topics, and we couldn\u2019t do all of them. That\u2019s why we spent quite a bit of time, at first, to figure out what everybody was interested in and what direction we could take. It was a difficult conversation for all of us because we all wanted to compromise for the group but still be interested on the topic. After a few meeting, we kind of figured it out, and then it was time to think about the intervention. The design of the intervention wasn\u2019t easy either, but we got the hang of it as soon as we decided the goal we wanted to reach: explore how alterations of one\u2019s face can change the perception of oneself. At the beginning, we thought about playing with face prosthetics or deformations, while also exploring the identity of a community as a concept. Our main idea was to build some face prosthetics and introduce ourselves to a small Ball Room community in Barcelona to do the intervention. We soon realized we didn\u2019t have the time and resources to deliver this kind of intervention, and we had to tone it down a few knots to make it fit into our context. The final result of our intervention left aside the research of a community\u2019s identity and focused more on the perception of altering your own face. It has been good reflecting on the whole process we\u2019ve been through to understand that, even though in the beginning of an experience you have some expectations, you also have to adapt to your colleagues, the work pace of everyone and the resources you have and try to achieve a similar goal while being coherent with everything. Personal Design Space update \u00b6 The way my Design Space has changed thanks to this experience isn\u2019t the most obvious one. After reflecting on the Design Intervention concept and gone through the exercise, I\u2019ve changed 2 things of my Design Space. Firstly, I\u2019ve added a sub-part that connects 2 weak signals: social media and non-heteropatriarcal innovation. In this sub-part I want to fit in my interest in the perception we have as a society of \u201cbeauty\u201d and how it affects us, specially women and specially teenagers and middle-aged women. I\u2019ve been interested to see how the new generations are evolving with the same concept of \u201cbeauty\u201d and this differences confronts the generations/age groups when living in society. A couple of decades ago, the concept of \u201cbeauty\u201d was a much closed box where, if you didn\u2019t fit into, you were out of. Nowadays, it seems to be a bit more open and accepting but still very much a box. It\u2019s also interesting to see how, even though we are more \u201copen\u201d to different forms of beauty, at the same time there are much more \u201cbeauty treatments\u201d, operations and interventions to alter our faces and bodies\u2026 Second of all, I\u2019ve gathered a list of Design Interventions I could personally do to explore other parts of my Design Space I don\u2019t know much about or O haven\u2019t specifically experienced in my own skin.

What can a design intervention be? Can and should be developed with others in context - An opportunity to co-create and iterate prototypes with others An experience that transforms yourself and others - open your mind to new scopes An action to start building trust - the first step to human relationships is trust in order to be able to co-create Am activity to bring difficult topics to the table - safe space An experience to learn and from others An experience to learn through a situated action - understanding the context that will allow us to propose something. To understand the direction that one\u2019s trying to take in the project. Relationship between Design Intervention and Design Space The Design Intervention will allow us to show the context that the Design Space is mapping so that we can create iterations of the Design Space diagram and investigate new elements in it. A Design Intervention doesn\u2019t have to be perfect or unique, is a key part of a process that consists in several actions that will lead us to build the final design space (if it ever exists). A Design Intervention can be used to understand issues we don\u2019t control, to clear our minds about them, to research unknown paths or to validate already existing ones. The four key roles a Design Intervention can have within a Design Space are: \u2794 Organizational: to visualize the ideas we have in a Design Space \u2794 Narrative: to give a voice to these ideas, so we can understand their process and development \u2794 Performative or Participative: to involve stakeholders or make it understand to the public \u2794 Inspirational: to research new developments and continue the journey Exercise A. Start sharing the elements we have printed in a big board and relate them to the ones everyone brought. B. In groups, create a Collective Design Space According to the Collective Design Space Mural we assembeled a group with similar interests. My group was formed by Annna, Everardo, Francisca and Drishya. Together we talked about our areas of interest and came up with a group Collective Design Space. C. Think about a Design Intervention to make within the shared interests and Design Space. Finally, after exploring many options we decided to conduct the following Design Intervention: We\u2019ve designed a collective Design Intervention to explore how alterations of your face can change your perception of yourself; either hide a part of you or enhance it. We want to give the possibility of changing your face to a specific group of people, and allow them to reflect on reconfiguration of the body. This change they can apply to their faces, might be on purpose to hide a part they don\u2019t like or either enhance another one they love. For the intervention, we have organized an event or party at Everardo\u2019s house with our friends. We believe that the relaxed atmosphere of this type of space gives the participant more room to get carried away. Our intervention wants to explore the following questions: - Did you choose to alter your face to hide or change a part of yourself you don\u2019t like? Or to enhace your existing identity? - After changing your face, do you feel more like yourself or less like yourself?","title":"Contents"},{"location":"term1/Session%202/#reflection","text":"","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term1/Session%202/#reflection-on-the-collective-design-space","text":"Doing the Collective Design Space was a bit overwhelming for me at first.

Once I looked at the wall I also felt a bit overwhelmed, so I quickly focused on a specific area of it, the one that interested me the most. Even though I choose an area of the wall, I was interested in all the groups that were formed, every topic chosen could\u2019ve fit in my own interests.

It was a difficult conversation for all of us because we all wanted to compromise for the group but still be interested on the topic. After a few meeting, we kind of figured it out, and then it was time to think about the intervention.

The exercise consisted in passing the thread among all of us while controlling the network that was being formed with a reflection on how we are living the master and the learning of the last weeks.

The operation of the seminar basically consisted of unpacking and disassembling old and unused machines (TVs, printers, speakers, microwaves\u2026) in order to understand how they work on the inside. Later on, once we have the components identified and prove that they work, figure out a new way to reassemble them, designing a new machine. How? \u00b6 Forensics of the obsolescence \u00b6 The first part of the seminar (first 4 days) was about the forensics of obsolescence. This concept wants to talk about how technology isn\u2019t a neutral element; it depends on many factors such as economic powers, influences, certain interests\u2026 At the end of the day, technology is a cultural artifact; it represents the society it grows into, and within the whole process of developing technology, many cultural decisions have to be made. The deliverable of the first part of the seminar was a Forensic Report on a chosen machine. I was lucky enough to work with Marius, Anna, Jorge, Flora, and Anthuanet to deliver the document of the Forensic Report. To create the document, we went through a process of disassembling an old LCD screen from beginning to end. We started by disassembling the main parts to understand it, then assembling them again to see which components were working and which weren\u2019t. We found out the connection between the motherboard and the screen wasn\u2019t working, so the machine was powered and turned on but couldn\u2019t play any content. We then continued disassembling the LCD screen itself and did some research on the different layers of filters it has. We were interested in powering on the backlight of the screen, but the connection cables were too old, and we accidentally broke them. We ended up with 2 functional strips of 80 LED lights each; we could power on and off the strips by little 10 LED strings. Rethink and reconnect \u00b6 The second part of the seminar \u201cThe Machine Paradox\u201d started at the end of the first week, once we had analyzed every component in our broken machine and categorized which ones worked and how they worked, it became the time to brainstorm new machines from what we had around. We had to build new machines basing our design on 4 principles: Honesty: the same design has to explain itself, do not hide anything. Simplicity: reducing processes and materials to the essential number. Uselessness: without a real and useful functionality for anyone. Process: acknowledge the process behind the design and give it value. With my group, once we got all the information, we did a brainstorm together to put on a piece of paper all of the ideas all of us had been gathering the previous days. We saw that there were a lot of ideas coming from all 6 of us, maybe too many. So, we decided to group the ideas into 3 main topics and split into pairs to explore these topics and come up with a proposition. The 3 final ideas we got out of this brainstorm were: an endless cycle machine to activate a ventilator, a FOMO machine to reflect on the pain screens induce on us, and a random Tik Tok scroll machine to represent the frustration of the lack of control. After evaluating the ideas and consulting with the teachers, we chose the FOMO machine. The FOMO machine, or The Fuck Duck Machine, is a device that wants to reflect on \"how much pain are we willing to take to feed our FOMO?\". We understand the concept FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) as the anxiety created by an event happening elsewhere and you didn't attend. The Fuck Duck Machine feeds this FOMO feeling by revealing part of the content on the screen every time you press a button that also induces pain. Once we had the idea, we had to properly design it and plan the whole building process. We agreed on the design and saw that the machine had ultimately 3 parts: the main box, the motor and Arduino for it, and finally the pain button. Since we all knew what materials and methods we were going to use for the parts, we split them considering the personal interests and skills of everyone. In my case, I started building the pain button with Annna. The proper building of the machine was the longest part and the most intense one. A lot of us were facing machines and materials we had never touched before, and it was a bit challenging. Personally, I really liked being able to research and investigate how to make a button that induces pain to the user. At the end of the day, we couldn\u2019t find anything on the market similar because it goes against regulations, so we had to build it ourselves. The first plan was to 3D print a button to integrate the internal part of a lighter (which would induce a small electroshock every time you clicked it). The process of 3D printing was difficult and long, and we soon realized that we had to also integrate the button that would give the signal to the Arduino board, so we had double complexity. We changed plans and built a transparent block of layers of laser-cut acrylic, so we could control the size of the holes on every layer and integrate both buttons (that were completely different). Finally, the challenge was to create a \u201ccover\u201d that would activate both buttons at the same time and allow the electricity to pass to the finger pressing it. We considered plastic, but we were faced with the same problem as before; it was too complex and time-consuming (we were running out of time at this point). We finally built a 3-layer wooden cover to go on top of the buttons with a hole for the cable to electroshock. The last problem we had was that the electricity didn\u2019t go through the cable if the wooden cover was on, and, in fact, it only worked if a finger or a metallic piece pressed it. We solved the problem by putting copper tape around it. Once we all finished the building process, we had the final result of our Fuck Duck Machine. It was the moment to shoot a <1 minute video self-explanatory on how the machine worked and what it did. We received help to draw our storyboard, and once this was done, the filming process was pretty quick. We got to do some acting and have some fun after finishing the machine. Reflections \u00b6 19/10/2023 17:55 \u00b6 After completing the Forensics of the obsolescence part The thing that has shocked me the most these 3 days has been the disassembling part. Tearing apart the TV monitor and realizing that behind every screen we see, there\u2019s actually real materials and not just an \u201cether\u201d that \u201ctransports data\u201d into the \u201ccloud\u201d. Learning the physical elements behind a screen, that for me is something unreal, untouchable, doesn\u2019t belong to the world of objects, made me open my view to other products i use in my everyday life and think how might they be made, what\u2019s inside of them\u2026 It has reminded me of a video made by a friend of mine, very worth seeing: The impact of the internet from helena boet on Vimeo . It was very interesting, also, starting this project (that for me is a bit out of my league) with people I don\u2019t know, at all. It has been working out very well, I\u2019m glad to see we all have a proactive attitude towards the class and I\u2019m enjoying getting to know them through it. 28/10/2023 10:59 \u00b6 After presenting the final project the day before Yesterday, we presented our unuseful machine, The Fuck Duck Machine. Today, after a restful night and some time to reflect, I\u2019ve gathered a few insights from the past few weeks. Firstly, collaborating with a group of unfamiliar faces flows more smoothly when we\u2019re engaged in practical, hands-on activities. It was my first time working with my team (and meeting them at all), and we quickly understood how we all worked and what we were able to do at any given point. I think this fast learning from each other was caused by the intensity of the project but also because it was a practical project. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t have learned that much if we had spent the 2 weeks all sitting at a table talking and hypothetically designing. As for how my relationship with technology is evolving, I still empathize with what I wrote in the last reflection; the power of comprehending the inner workings of things. Last week, I was talking about how much it shocked me to see the components behind an LCD screen. This week I\u2019ve seen this importance also in understanding the machines and techniques we use to build. For example, when Santi very kindly explained to me how the laser cut machine worked and all of the steps you have to take before sending the file to cut, I understood and learned what he was explaining. Later on, when I had to manage the machine by myself, I didn\u2019t remember the steps by memory but because I understood them, and it made sense to me. This logic can apply to every machine and material I\u2019ve used, such as the 3D printer, Arduino, vinyl cutter, woodworking, electroshock, and more. Another important lesson I\u2019ve learned is that in the face of failure, it\u2019s wiser to attempt to repair what has gone wrong before scrapping the whole project. However, there\u2019s a fine line when it comes to investing your energy in a fix. It\u2019s crucial to know when it\u2019s best to move on. I\u2019m still learning when to let go or not of my initial ideas. I\u2019m a planner and I like following straight paths, but in prototyping and design in general, there isn\u2019t such a thing. Lastly, I\u2019m aware I wouldn\u2019t have accomplished this project or the learning I take with me without the help of our teachers and the collaboration of my colleagues. At the end of the day, no one knows everything, and everyone knows a bit of everything.

Later on, once we have the components identified and prove that they work, figure out a new way to reassemble them, designing a new machine.","title":"What?"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#how","text":"","title":"How?"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#forensics-of-the-obsolescence","text":"The first part of the seminar (first 4 days) was about the forensics of obsolescence. This concept wants to talk about how technology isn\u2019t a neutral element; it depends on many factors such as economic powers, influences, certain interests\u2026 At the end of the day, technology is a cultural artifact; it represents the society it grows into, and within the whole process of developing technology, many cultural decisions have to be made. The deliverable of the first part of the seminar was a Forensic Report on a chosen machine. I was lucky enough to work with Marius, Anna, Jorge, Flora, and Anthuanet to deliver the document of the Forensic Report. To create the document, we went through a process of disassembling an old LCD screen from beginning to end. We started by disassembling the main parts to understand it, then assembling them again to see which components were working and which weren\u2019t. We found out the connection between the motherboard and the screen wasn\u2019t working, so the machine was powered and turned on but couldn\u2019t play any content. We then continued disassembling the LCD screen itself and did some research on the different layers of filters it has. We were interested in powering on the backlight of the screen, but the connection cables were too old, and we accidentally broke them. We ended up with 2 functional strips of 80 LED lights each; we could power on and off the strips by little 10 LED strings.","title":"Forensics of the obsolescence"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#rethink-and-reconnect","text":"The second part of the seminar \u201cThe Machine Paradox\u201d started at the end of the first week, once we had analyzed every component in our broken machine and categorized which ones worked and how they worked, it became the time to brainstorm new machines from what we had around. We had to build new machines basing our design on 4 principles: Honesty: the same design has to explain itself, do not hide anything. Simplicity: reducing processes and materials to the essential number. Uselessness: without a real and useful functionality for anyone. Process: acknowledge the process behind the design and give it value. With my group, once we got all the information, we did a brainstorm together to put on a piece of paper all of the ideas all of us had been gathering the previous days. We saw that there were a lot of ideas coming from all 6 of us, maybe too many. So, we decided to group the ideas into 3 main topics and split into pairs to explore these topics and come up with a proposition. The 3 final ideas we got out of this brainstorm were: an endless cycle machine to activate a ventilator, a FOMO machine to reflect on the pain screens induce on us, and a random Tik Tok scroll machine to represent the frustration of the lack of control. After evaluating the ideas and consulting with the teachers, we chose the FOMO machine. The FOMO machine, or The Fuck Duck Machine, is a device that wants to reflect on \"how much pain are we willing to take to feed our FOMO?\". We understand the concept FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) as the anxiety created by an event happening elsewhere and you didn't attend. The Fuck Duck Machine feeds this FOMO feeling by revealing part of the content on the screen every time you press a button that also induces pain. Once we had the idea, we had to properly design it and plan the whole building process. We agreed on the design and saw that the machine had ultimately 3 parts: the main box, the motor and Arduino for it, and finally the pain button. Since we all knew what materials and methods we were going to use for the parts, we split them considering the personal interests and skills of everyone. In my case, I started building the pain button with Annna. The proper building of the machine was the longest part and the most intense one. A lot of us were facing machines and materials we had never touched before, and it was a bit challenging. Personally, I really liked being able to research and investigate how to make a button that induces pain to the user. At the end of the day, we couldn\u2019t find anything on the market similar because it goes against regulations, so we had to build it ourselves. The first plan was to 3D print a button to integrate the internal part of a lighter (which would induce a small electroshock every time you clicked it). The process of 3D printing was difficult and long, and we soon realized that we had to also integrate the button that would give the signal to the Arduino board, so we had double complexity. We changed plans and built a transparent block of layers of laser-cut acrylic, so we could control the size of the holes on every layer and integrate both buttons (that were completely different). Finally, the challenge was to create a \u201ccover\u201d that would activate both buttons at the same time and allow the electricity to pass to the finger pressing it. We considered plastic, but we were faced with the same problem as before; it was too complex and time-consuming (we were running out of time at this point). We finally built a 3-layer wooden cover to go on top of the buttons with a hole for the cable to electroshock. The last problem we had was that the electricity didn\u2019t go through the cable if the wooden cover was on, and, in fact, it only worked if a finger or a metallic piece pressed it. We solved the problem by putting copper tape around it. Once we all finished the building process, we had the final result of our Fuck Duck Machine. It was the moment to shoot a <1 minute video self-explanatory on how the machine worked and what it did. We received help to draw our storyboard, and once this was done, the filming process was pretty quick. We got to do some acting and have some fun after finishing the machine.","title":"Rethink and reconnect"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#reflections","text":"","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#19102023-1755","text":"After completing the Forensics of the obsolescence part The thing that has shocked me the most these 3 days has been the disassembling part. Tearing apart the TV monitor and realizing that behind every screen we see, there\u2019s actually real materials and not just an \u201cether\u201d that \u201ctransports data\u201d into the \u201ccloud\u201d. Learning the physical elements behind a screen, that for me is something unreal, untouchable, doesn\u2019t belong to the world of objects, made me open my view to other products i use in my everyday life and think how might they be made, what\u2019s inside of them\u2026 It has reminded me of a video made by a friend of mine, very worth seeing: The impact of the internet from helena boet on Vimeo . It was very interesting, also, starting this project (that for me is a bit out of my league) with people I don\u2019t know, at all. It has been working out very well, I\u2019m glad to see we all have a proactive attitude towards the class and I\u2019m enjoying getting to know them through it.","title":"19/10/2023 17:55"},{"location":"term1/The%20Machine%20Paradox2/#28102023-1059","text":"After presenting the final project the day before Yesterday, we presented our unuseful machine, The Fuck Duck Machine. Today, after a restful night and some time to reflect, I\u2019ve gathered a few insights from the past few weeks. Firstly, collaborating with a group of unfamiliar faces flows more smoothly when we\u2019re engaged in practical, hands-on activities. It was my first time working with my team (and meeting them at all), and we quickly understood how we all worked and what we were able to do at any given point. I think this fast learning from each other was caused by the intensity of the project but also because it was a practical project. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t have learned that much if we had spent the 2 weeks all sitting at a table talking and hypothetically designing. As for how my relationship with technology is evolving, I still empathize with what I wrote in the last reflection; the power of comprehending the inner workings of things. Last week, I was talking about how much it shocked me to see the components behind an LCD screen. This week I\u2019ve seen this importance also in understanding the machines and techniques we use to build. For example, when Santi very kindly explained to me how the laser cut machine worked and all of the steps you have to take before sending the file to cut, I understood and learned what he was explaining. Later on, when I had to manage the machine by myself, I didn\u2019t remember the steps by memory but because I understood them, and it made sense to me. This logic can apply to every machine and material I\u2019ve used, such as the 3D printer, Arduino, vinyl cutter, woodworking, electroshock, and more. Another important lesson I\u2019ve learned is that in the face of failure, it\u2019s wiser to attempt to repair what has gone wrong before scrapping the whole project. However, there\u2019s a fine line when it comes to investing your energy in a fix. It\u2019s crucial to know when it\u2019s best to move on. I\u2019m still learning when to let go or not of my initial ideas. I\u2019m a planner and I like following straight paths, but in prototyping and design in general, there isn\u2019t such a thing. Lastly, I\u2019m aware I wouldn\u2019t have accomplished this project or the learning I take with me without the help of our teachers and the collaboration of my colleagues. At the end of the day, no one knows everything, and everyone knows a bit of everything. If I had to do this by myself, I would\u2019ve designed a much less original machine in a much longer period of time.","title":"28/10/2023 10:59"}]}
